Fisheries administrations have autonomy in how they manage activity allowing each administration to structure its operations in ways that suit their own specific management issues. However, all administrations work together to ensure that collectively there are common standards of monitoring and enforcement of EU legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the reporting requirements that are set out in EU legislation, the master, owner or charterer of a licensed fishing vessel can be required to provide statistical information and other information. Details are in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/84/introduction\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSea Fisheries (Conservation) Act 1967\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/60/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSea Fish (Conservation) Act 1992\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe method and exact nature of the data collected on fishing activity depends on the length of the vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-collection-for-vessels-over-10-metres-in-length\"\u003eData collection for vessels over 10 metres in length\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fishing logbook is the primary method of data collection. It captures data on fishing activity by individual vessels by trip, and for each day of activity within a trip. This includes details of the catch, by species, in terms of the presentation and quantity of fish retained on board. Information is also collected on the fishing gear used and the area where the fish were caught. Area details are \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/maps/Pages/default.aspx\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edivision, rectangle and zone\u003c/a\u003e as defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (\u003cabbr title=\"The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\"\u003eICES\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSupplying logbook data is legally required for all over 10 metre vessels for catches of all species. Data for UK vessels must be submitted within 48 hours of landing to UK authorities – this includes landings into foreign ports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLanding declarations provide information on the weight and presentation of fish landed by species. As with logbooks, landing declarations must be submitted to authorities within 48 hours of landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSales notes are required in respect of first sales of fish and fishery products. Sales notes for first sales of fish must be submitted within 48 hours of sale (24 hours if submitting electronically) by the registered buyer of the fish, except at designated auction centres where the registered seller has responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 1 July 2012, UK fisheries administrations have been enforcing a strict expectation that all UK fishing vessels 15 metres and over in length should be reporting logbook and landing declaration data electronically. Fisheries administrations have now extended this to vessels 12 metres and over in length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, from 1 January 2009, buyers and sellers with an annual turnover of first sale fish of more than €400,000 have been required to submit sales notes electronically. This threshold was reduced to €200,000 from 1 January 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA UK \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/record-and-report-your-fishing-activity-and-submit-sales-notes#what-are-electronic-logbooks\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eelectronic reporting systems (ERS) hub\u003c/a\u003e has been set-up to collect, process, and store the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe requirements to report data on fishing activity are set out by EU legislation. Each fisheries administration operates a system of checking the individual submissions of data to ensure their accuracy and completeness. The rules applied are common across each administration and based on the structure set out in EU legislation for the fishing logbook, landing declaration and sales notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese checks are to ensure that valid data are reported within the returns and that internal checks within the submitted data are carried out to ensure consistency. In addition there are systems in place that carry out cross-checks between the activity data reported and other sources of information on activity. These include satellite position reports and sightings of vessels collected by each administration during air, sea or land surveillance activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUK fisheries administrations therefore operate common standards and procedures to ensure the consistent treatment of the data within the collection processes. This ensures that UK data are consistent with EU requirements for completeness and accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe electronic reporting systems operated by fishing vessels contain a limited range of validation checks to help ensure correct data are reported. The electronic hub that receives and processes the data has additional checks using a suite of business rules and generates failure messages that are set to the vessel operators in cases whether the business rules are breached. Skippers would be required to resubmit corrected data. The data entry systems used to capture information from paper declarations contains similar checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn cases where a discrepancy has been identified, corrections are made to the data as appropriate. Any discrepancy found could be indicative of a breach of EU legislation, either in terms of incorrect reporting of activity or the activity reported might be in breach of EU requirements. These discrepancies are investigated and appropriate actions taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese can range from a simple verbal instruction to the vessel operator advising them of how to correctly report information, up to a full prosecution of the master and/or owners of the vessels concerned if a serious offence has been found to have been committed. Minor issues are usually corrected during the data capture process. For more serious and larger scale issues then corrections may not be made until after the results of prosecutions are known. Details of recent prosecutions carried out by the \u003cabbr title=\"Marine Management Organisation\"\u003eMMO\u003c/abbr\u003e can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/topic/commercial-fishing-fisheries/regulations-monitoring-enforcement\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eenforcement news\u003c/a\u003e section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-collection-for-vessels-10-metres-and-under-in-length\"\u003eData collection for vessels 10 metres and under in length\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor 10 metre and under vessels, there is no statutory requirement for fishermen to declare their catches. Historically, information for this sector has been collected with the co-operation of the industry and included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elog sheets and landing declarations voluntarily supplied by fishermen\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esales notes and assessments of landings collected from market sources and by officials located in the ports\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis data collection has been replaced after the Registration of Buyers and Sellers of First-Sale Fish Scheme was introduced in September 2005. Registered buyers are now legally required to provide sales notes for commercially sold fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring 2005 and 2006, UK fisheries administrations introduced a system of restrictive licensing for activity targeted at shellfish. As part of this system, new reporting requirements were introduced requiring fishermen fishing with 10 metre and under vessels to complete diaries of their daily activity to be submitted each month. Summary information from these diaries is now in use in Northern Ireland but was discontinued in the rest of the UK at the end of February 2009.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-coverage\"\u003eData coverage\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData collection for vessels over 10 metres in length aims to achieve full coverage of activity by this sector of the fleet, i.e. these vessels are required to submit complete details on their activity every time they go to sea to fish commercially. For the 10 metre and under sector, landings are recorded on sales notes provided by the registered buyers. Some information, such as gear and fishing area, are not recorded on the sales note but this information is added by coastal staff based on local knowledge of the vessels they administer - for example, from observations of the vessel during inspections at ports or from air and sea surveillance activities as well as discussions with the owner and/or operator of the vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 1 January 2011 the Isle of Man authorities became fully integrated with the data collection and recording systems operated by mainland fisheries administrations, enabling the inclusion of details of the activity of their vessels that was previously not available. This meant the aggregate summary totals the Isle of Man previously supplied to supplement UK activity data were replaced by records showing the same level of detail as provided by mainland vessels. Landings for the larger Channel Islands fleet are also recorded on the data systems, but relatively small amounts of landings by the smaller vessels (less than one tenth of one per cent of all UK fleet landings) are not included. Details of these landings are provided by Jersey and Guernsey authorities for quota management purposes but they are excluded from the monthly statistics publication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reliability of the data collected is dependent on the information provided by fishermen. The reporting requirements on fishermen are set out by EU legislation with each administration producing guidance notes for fishermen on what their reporting obligations are. As mentioned above, UK fisheries administrations carry out a mix of manual and automatic checks on the information provided by vessel operators. These include a check between logbook information and that given in the sales notes or observed as landed as well as checks against other sources of information like satellite position reports, information from aerial and at-sea surveillance and inspection activity carried out by UK enforcement officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite legal obligations for fishermen to declare their catches, a proportion of fishing activity remains unreported. A 2009 study jointly funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for International Development (Agnew DJ, Pearce J, Pramod G, Peatman T, Watson R, et al. (2009) Estimating the Worldwide Extent of Illegal Fishing. PloS ONE 4(2):e4570) estimated that between 2000 and 2003, illegal fishing in the northeast Atlantic amounted to between 5 and 13 per cent of reported catches of species studied. So the extent of illegal and unreported fishing by UK vessels is uncertain and will vary across stocks. However, it is considered that the overall level of unreported fishing has been reduced in recent years following the introduction of a scheme of registration for buyers and sellers of first-sale fish, and the implementation of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The statistics published in the monthly return represent landings reported to the fisheries administrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLandings do not typically equal total catches, as fish may be discarded. Discarding could occur in cases where fishermen would accidently catch fish which they did not have quota for, catch damaged or less profitable fish, or catch undersized fish which they could not sell. The degree of discarding varies by stock, and with the area and type of fishing being carried out. Details of levels of discards can be found in the advice released by \u003cabbr title=\"The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\"\u003eICES\u003c/abbr\u003e each year as it forms an important element of the assessment of the state of fish stocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EU’s new landing obligation, being phased in from 2015 onwards, is intended to end the discarding of marketable fish back into the sea, which has proved to be bad for fish stocks, bad for the marine environment and costly for fishermen. A specific assessment has been collated of this information for fisheries including those that take place around the UK or are of interest to UK fishing vessels that will be covered by the landing obligation.  More details are available at:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nsrac.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/discardatlas_northsea_demersalfisheries_2014.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ediscard Atlas of North Sea fisheries\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nwwac.org\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ediscard Atlas of the North Western Waters demersal fisheries\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo allow fishermen to adapt to the change, the landing obligation was introduced gradually, between 2015 and 2019 for all commercial fisheries of species subject to annual quotas. As of 1 January 2019, the landing obligation has been in force for almost all quota stocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-processing\"\u003eData processing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInformation from log sheets, landing declarations, sales notes and other sources is keyed into computers connected to the main databases by government staff at port offices, or is transferred electronically from the UK ERS Hub. Individual database structures will differ for each fisheries administration but the details collected will be the same. Data from each administration’s database are merged into a single unified database for analysis.\nDetails of the areas fished are taken from the logbooks and entered as codes for the \u003cabbr title=\"The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea\"\u003eICES\u003c/abbr\u003e divisions and statistical rectangles. Where a statistical rectangle is split into different areas – for instance, where it’s partly in EU waters and partly in Norwegian waters – an extra code is used to indicate the zone fished. Where a vessel fishes in more than one area in a single trip, the total amounts for the trip of each species, as given in the sales notes and landing declarations are allocated to the areas in proportion to the estimated quantities of the species taken from each area, as recorded in the logbook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn many cases only the weight of fish landed is provided, as it is impractical to record the weight of fish at the time of capture due to working conditions. The landed weight may differ significantly from the weight of the fish as it was taken from the sea, in large part due to the processing of the catch on board the vessel, such as gutting and filleting. To render the data comparable, the landed weights are automatically converted to a live weight equivalent using standard EU conversion factors according to the species landed and its presentation, e.g. gutted or skinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe data capture systems used include sets of business rules to check that the data being submitted for each fishing trip conform to certain standards – this includes checking individual data items to ensure that they are valid entries (e.g. a date is a valid date, text is not entered where a number is expected, valid information for ports visited or species landed are reported etc.) The business rules are maintained by database managers and reviewed by statisticians on a regular basis. The complete fishing records are transmitted to the central computer systems where further checks are carried out on the data before they are reflected in the main landings databases. These checks include more detailed processing of the data reported for a fishing trip comparing the data elements reports to make sure that the information for a trip is internally consistent – e.g. making sure that a date of landing is after the date of departure for a trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the validation processes listed above, the information reported by fishermen is run through automatic cross-checks with other sources of information on activity available to fisheries administrations to ensure consistency and accuracy in the information reported. The majority of these checks are mandated within the EU legislation. These checks include comparing the activity data reported against the satellite tracking data that larger fishing vessels are required to operate while they are at sea; checking the information reported in logbooks against the data reported by auction centres and fish merchants for fish sold by the vessel operators; comparisons against any information on sightings of vessels while at sea by fisheries administrations’ surveillance vessels and aerial surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegular checks on data validity are also carried out by the statistics team as an extra safeguard. These include identifying unlikely combinations of species and fishing area which are reported to port staff for correction where necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the processes and checks outlined above to ensure the quality of the data captured and held on fishing activity, the European Commission and its associated bodies carry out inspections and audits of the UK’s systems to control fishing activity. Within these inspections, visiting officials investigate various aspects of the overall administrative processes in place to control fishing activity to review the degree to which they comply with the EU legislative obligations. Appropriate actions are taken in light of the results of these inspections to ensure that the administrative systems in place are fit for purpose and provide the required level of control on fishing activity. More information on the EU system for fisheries controls is available on the DG MARE website – the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Marine Management Organisation\"\u003eMMO\u003c/abbr\u003e holds information on all landings into England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man by UK vessels and of landings abroad by vessels administered by \u003cabbr title=\"Marine Management Organisation\"\u003eMMO\u003c/abbr\u003e, Welsh Government, DAERA and Isle of Man Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture.

Fisheries administrations also issue a breakdown of landings to the Producer Organisations who are asked to reconcile the landings with their members’ fishing trips as part of the validation process. Also, before the data are published, amendments are made to records with implausible average prices based on average prices for the same species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen calculating average prices, landings with zero value are excluded to give a true reflection of the price of fish being sold. There are various reasons why landings may have a zero value – some fish which cannot be sold and have a zero value, like undersized fish landed as part of catch quota work, or scientific dispensation landings that cannot be sold but have to be recorded in sales notes to allow cross checks with landing declarations. There are also instances where fish are not offered for sale or are intended for sale at a later date. This was a relatively new issue following the introduction of electronic reporting and mainly affected large landings of herring and mackerel into the Netherlands and Germany, accounting for around 5 per cent of all UK landings. However, an annual exercise saw imputed values, based on sales agents’ price figures, being added to the database from 2012 onwards. \nInformation can be found in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-sea-fisheries-annual-statistics-report-2017\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAppendix 4 of UK Sea Fisheries Statistics\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-revisions-policy\"\u003eData revisions: Policy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Marine Management Organisation\"\u003eMMO\u003c/abbr\u003e produces its annual statistical publication, UK Sea Fisheries Statistics, in September each year.

This analysis will be repeated for 2018 data once the annual publication has been released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on latest figures for UK vessels landing into the UK, lags in data for all fish are relatively small (see the ‘all fish’ chart in the sheet ‘1. UK land into UK’, and the data highlighted in yellow in the sheet ‘6. chart data’). For example, for 2015 data, the first estimates of cumulative landings for the year are generally around 1 per cent lower than the most recent estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, lags are far more pronounced for UK vessels landing abroad and for foreign vessels landing into the UK, since it takes longer to receive a full set of complete and validated documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLags are also more pronounced for demersal and shellfish species, whereas pelagic lags are very small. This is because pelagic fisheries are dominated by very large fishing vessels targeting industrial sized quantities of a small number of species (almost always landed whole) in fewer, but longer, fishing trips. Skippers and their agents are likely to operate highly organised businesses and completion of documentation will generally be to a higher standard requiring less manual intervention by data entry teams at the coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrips involving demersal fish and shellfish comprise a larger number of vessels, fishing a greater number of trips and catching a wider range of species in far smaller amounts. Fish can have a range of presentations and the logbooks are more likely to be problematic, and the sheer volume of these landings can give rise to backlogs. Also, most shellfish species are not subject to quota and effort management and so have a lower priority in terms of data entry. Despite this, the actual tonnage identified in lags for these demersal and shellfish trips is relatively small compared with overall landings being reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-revisions-monthly-figures\"\u003eData revisions: Monthly figures\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA new ‘revisions triangle’ analysis of the change in monthly figures for the same five categories of landings can be viewed in the spreadsheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6012d01bd3bf7f05c527c14b/Monthly_lags_-_current_month.ods\"\u003e\n        \u003csvg class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--spreadsheet\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 99 140\" width=\"99\" height=\"140\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M12 12h75v27H12zm0 47h18.75v63H12zm55 2v59H51V61h16m2-2H49v63h20V59z\" stroke-width=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M49 61.05V120H32.8V61.05H49m2-2H30.75v63H51V59zm34 2V120H69.05V61.05H85m2-2H67v63h20V59z\" stroke-width=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M30 68.5h56.5M30 77.34h56.5M30 112.7h56.5M30 95.02h56.5M30 86.18h56.5M30 103.86h56.5\" fill=\"none\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\n\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6012d01bd3bf7f05c527c14b/Monthly_lags_-_current_month.ods\"\u003eMonthly_lags_-_current_month_ODF_\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"OpenDocument Spreadsheet\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003eODS\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e114 KB\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n        \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\n          This file is in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-open-document-formats-odf-in-your-organisation\" target=\"_self\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOpenDocument\u003c/a\u003e format\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis shows how the first reported figures (or first estimates) change as the year progresses.

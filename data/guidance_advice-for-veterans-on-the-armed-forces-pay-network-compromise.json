While we do not currently have any proof that data has been compromised, we must be prudent and assume that it may have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are writing to all veterans who left from January 2018 onwards, and who are in receipt of a payment from the affected payment system. It is possible that these veterans may be affected by this potential compromise and we assume that they may have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo provide additional protection, MOD has purchased licences with a market-leading personal data protection service. Veterans who receive a letter informing them that they may be impacted will be able to access the service on a device of their choice. This will help the assurance, safety and security of data. The system will provide early warning and alerts detailing any unauthorised use or exploitation of your personnel data, on the internet or dark web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis incident potentially impacts the personal data of current regular and reservist personnel and a small number of veterans. The data includes names and bank details, and for a small proportion of individuals, addresses. Address data may be place of work, administration address, or home address. Those whose home address is identified are in the process of being written to. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have taken immediate remedial action, taking the network offline to minimise risk. Initial investigations have found no evidence that any data has been removed from the network, but we will continue to investigate, working closely with other agencies. We have also launched a full review, drawing on specialist external and Cabinet Office support and expertise. We are also investigating potential failings by the contractor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have received a letter from the Ministry of Defence about this, you can contact us via a dedicated phone line: 01249 596665 or e-mail \u003ca href=\"mailto:DBS-Informationline@mod.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDBS-Informationline@mod.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e.

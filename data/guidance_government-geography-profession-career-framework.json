They are experts in understanding and analysing environmental and/or human processes and interactions in places and at scale and use their knowledge to provide advice and evaluate evidence in support of government challenges. Geographic advisors are adept at working in multi-disciplinary settings and coordinating the activities of these different professions to solve business and policy challenges that benefit from geographical insight.

Affiliates undertake wider roles across the whole of the public sector (for example in corporate services, operational delivery, policy or regulatory organisations) and may also identify with one of the other Civil Service professions.

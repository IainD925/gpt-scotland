The 2020 Regulations have been approved by Parliament and are now UK law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Human Medicines Regulations\"\u003eHMRs\u003c/abbr\u003e set out a comprehensive regime for the authorisation of medicinal products for human use; for the manufacture, import, distribution, sale and supply of those products; for their labelling and advertising; and for pharmacovigilance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey also provide for enforcement powers for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amendments to the \u003cabbr title=\"Human Medicines Regulations\"\u003eHMRs\u003c/abbr\u003e address the fact that the UK will no longer be part of the harmonised EU medicines network following the end of transition period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever in Northern Ireland the EU regulations will continue to apply in accordance with the Northern Ireland Protocol. They replicate the current arrangements so far as possible in Great Britain but also make appropriate changes to reflect the fact that the MHRA will operate outside of the EU network while acknowledging the special provisions that will apply in respect of Norther Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePart of maintaining the current position involves continued reliance on EU guidance documents. Where existing EU law refers to various pieces of EU guidance, those references are inserted into the 2012 Regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe relevant version of the EU guidance is the version as it stood immediately before the end of the transition period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose versions can be accessed below for reference in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to Northern Ireland, the relevant version of this guidance can be obtained from the EU websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-on-applications-for-marketing-authorisations-mas\"\u003eGuidance on applications for marketing authorisations (MAs)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/Z6aHlor0HPFKbaQX/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-on-inspections\"\u003eGuidance on inspections\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/57Rx6ph3Fw8FIcOx/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-on-packaging-and-leaflets\"\u003eGuidance on packaging and leaflets\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/dr60D6E0s5OjuV85/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-on-good-manufacturing-practice\"\u003eGuidance on Good Manufacturing Practice\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/YFfgMfZr4LLIRtrz/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guideline-on-similar-biological-medicinal-products\"\u003eGuideline on similar biological medicinal products\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/nhuJ8d3VMozV2wBs/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidelines-for-generic-medicinal-products-for-omitting-bioavailability-studies-from-an-application\"\u003eGuidelines for generic medicinal products for omitting bioavailability studies from an application\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/EMXnl5q3Aujq2b8k/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-for-medical-devices\"\u003eGuidance for medical devices\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/YN8mRpER1lUzi5BA/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidelines-for-variations\"\u003eGuidelines for variations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/A8gYexvP6E5jmaGf/fo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView all the files in this section\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

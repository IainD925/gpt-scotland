Instead of challenging this in court, a suitable option in the first instance could be for the potential licensee to request an \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e evaluator to assess the merits of the challenge and the likelihood of its success. Parties involved in \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patent\"\u003eSEP\u003c/abbr\u003e licensing disputes can utilise \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e to address a range of disputes including complex and technical issues involving larger businesses.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is an existing contractual relationship between the parties, it is likely that the contract will provide for \u003cabbr title=\"Alternative Dispute Resolution\"\u003eADR\u003c/abbr\u003e in one or more of its forms, and it may include a requirement for \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e. Whether or not the use of \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e has been agreed by both parties within a contract, the parties still have the flexibility to agree between themselves to refer a dispute to \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process of \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e involves appointing a neutral person known as the “evaluator” (parties can appoint someone privately or through the courts under the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part03\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCivil Procedure Rules\u003c/a\u003e (\u003cabbr title=\"Civil Procedure Rules\"\u003eCPR\u003c/abbr\u003e)).

An important difference to note between \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e and mediation is that \u003cabbr title=\"Neutral Evaluation\"\u003eENE\u003c/abbr\u003e allows the neutral person to give the parties their opinion on the merits of the case. In contrast, a mediator’s role is to facilitate discussion and encourage parties to try and reach an agreement or settlement without addressing the merits of their positions.

If the contract under which the parties have agreed for their dispute to be resolved by arbitration states that any finding can be binding internationally, then an arbitration finding can have global coverage.

In cases where no existing contract is yet in place, you can agree to resolve the dispute through arbitration and set up a separate arbitration agreement for this purpose. An arbitration agreement is a contract that evidences the fact that the parties have agreed to resolve the dispute using arbitration and provides clarity on who the parties to the arbitration are, the issues in dispute which the parties have agreed to be resolved by arbitration, the arbitration institute to be engaged, and the language, governing law and jurisdiction (seat) of the arbitration. It may also set out rules about appointing arbitrators and their required qualifications, and it may include provisions on how costs are apportioned, etc. It is worth noting that different arbitration institutes may have different rules and procedures regarding how the arbitration should be conducted in the absence of an agreement or a selected arbitration panel. It is important that you find this information out when deciding which arbitration institute you will use.    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce agreement is reached on the use of arbitration, the process is usually commenced by submitting the dispute to an arbitration institute and then appointing one or more arbitrators (who will hear and decide the dispute).

That is, for example, where a threat of an injunction may force a prospective licensee to accept a higher, or “non-\u003cabbr title=\"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\"\u003eFRAND\u003c/abbr\u003e-rate” to avoid the possibility of an injunction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInjunctions in \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patent\"\u003eSEP\u003c/abbr\u003e cases\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eObtaining an injunction in \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patents\"\u003eSEPs\u003c/abbr\u003e cases is different compared to ordinary patents cases due to the nature of \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patents\"\u003eSEPs\u003c/abbr\u003e and the \u003cabbr title=\"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\"\u003eFRAND\u003c/abbr\u003e licensing commitment given by a \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patent\"\u003eSEP\u003c/abbr\u003e holder to an \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Developing Organisation\"\u003eSDO\u003c/abbr\u003e.

The \u003cabbr title=\"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\"\u003eFRAND\u003c/abbr\u003e commitment in \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patents\"\u003eSEPs\u003c/abbr\u003e licensing is further explained in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/standard-essential-patent-licensing\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patent\"\u003eSEP\u003c/abbr\u003e licensing Guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe order for an injunction may in certain circumstances be ‘stayed’, i.e., suspended until a separate \u003cabbr title=\"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\"\u003eFRAND\u003c/abbr\u003e determination has been made by the court or where the case has been appealed (although an injunction to restrain patent infringement is not automatically stayed just because a judgment is subject to an appeal). If a defendant then refuses to enter into a licence on terms which the court has to be \u003cabbr title=\"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\"\u003eFRAND\u003c/abbr\u003e, the ‘stayed’ injunction will then take effect. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patent\"\u003eSEP\u003c/abbr\u003e cases in the UK, under current caselaw, there is only one type of injunction, which is a modified form of a permanent injunction: one where you have an injunction after finding of valid, infringed and essential patent which can be lifted if the party then enters into a licence (known as a \u003cabbr title=\"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\"\u003eFRAND\u003c/abbr\u003e Injunction) as outlined below. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information on relevant cases please visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-seps-case-law\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patents\"\u003eSEPs\u003c/abbr\u003e Case Law\u003c/a\u003e guidance in the Resource Hub. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnti-suit injunctions (\u003cabbr title=\"Anti-suit injunctions\"\u003eASIs\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the remedies discussed above, a party may request an \u003cabbr title=\"Anti-suit injunction\"\u003eASI\u003c/abbr\u003e. \u003cabbr title=\"Anti-suit injunctions\"\u003eASIs\u003c/abbr\u003e are a court order preventing a party from either commencing or continuing proceedings in a foreign court.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, \u003cabbr title=\"Anti-suit injunctions\"\u003eASIs\u003c/abbr\u003e are very uncommon and have not been granted in \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Essential Patent\"\u003eSEP\u003c/abbr\u003e cases in the UK (please see case law guidance).

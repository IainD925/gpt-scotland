Royal Mail are not at present capturing customer signatures but will instead log the name of the person accepting items sent by recorded delivery. This does, however, continue to meet the service requirement in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/67/section/6\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 6(1) of the 1981 Act\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"time-periods-for-responses\"\u003eTime periods for responses\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe would encourage acquiring authorities to consider whether it would be appropriate to increase time periods for people to respond when requesting information about interests in land to be acquired or submitting objections to CPOs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-documents-available-for-inspection\"\u003eMaking documents available for inspection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/67/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAcquisition of Land Act 1981\u003c/a\u003e requires acquiring authorities as part of their notification requirements for a compulsory purchase order after it is made, and again after it is confirmed, to name a place within the locality where a copy of the order and map can be inspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government considers that publication of the order and map online by the acquiring authority fulfils these requirements to publish in a ‘place’. However, to ensure that effective notice that a compulsory purchase order has been made is provided, and to mitigate any risk of prejudicing the interests of those who may not have ready access to the internet, acquiring authorities should ensure that notices also provide contact details for individuals to request a hard copy of the order and map.  Acquiring authorities with local offices which are open to the public should allow for inspection of documents in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government considers that similar requirements in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/2595/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCompulsory Purchase of Land (Prescribed Forms) (Ministers) Regulations 2004\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/2594/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCompulsory Purchase of Land (Written Representations Procedure) (Ministers) Regulations 2004\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/3617/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCompulsory Purchase (Inquiries Procedure Rules) 2007\u003c/a\u003e may be approached in the same way. Notices may specify an online location for inspection and acquiring authorities should post or email out copies of relevant documents where requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile care should be taken to ensure that documents are served in accordance with \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/67/section/6\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 6 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981\u003c/a\u003e where relevant, acquiring authorities may additionally wish to seek alternative addresses, including email addresses, where qualifying persons may have difficulty receiving notices at their primary address (e.g. where businesses are closed). It also may be appropriate to increase the deadlines for objections to allow more time for responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"return-of-documents-to-acquiring-authorities\"\u003eReturn of documents to acquiring authorities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere it is necessary for the DLUHC Planning Casework Unit (PCU) to return CPO documents to acquiring authorities and where this cannot be done electronically, PCU will contact the acquiring authority to agree where documents should be sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"decisions-remitted-back-to-acquiring-authorities\"\u003eDecisions remitted back to acquiring authorities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere CPOs are remitted back to acquiring authorities for confirmation, notices to the confirming authority should be sent by email and post. Where possible we will send decisions electronically. Hard copy documents will follow as soon as practically possible. Please note there might be a delay with this.

Acquiring authorities should contact DLUHC’s Planning Casework Unit at \u003ca href=\"mailto:PCU@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePCU@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e if they are expecting to submit a CPO within the next 6 months in order to discuss handling arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dealing-with-claimants\"\u003eDealing with claimants\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, when implementing CPOs, acquiring authorities should act responsibly in relation to both business and residential claimants, particularly in terms of the timing of vesting orders and compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcquiring authorities are reminded that under \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/26/section/52\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 52 of the Land Compensation Act 1973\u003c/a\u003e, an advance payment of compensation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emay be paid at any time after the compulsory acquisition has been authorised\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emust be paid in accordance with the deadlines in section 52(4)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcquiring authorities are also referred to paragraph 85 of the departmental guidance. Delays in making advance payments may have a more significant impact as a result of anticipated additional cash flow burdens at this time, so it is important that acquiring authorities ensure that they make timely payments to claimants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

It represents a significant milestone in our country’s journey towards leaving the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e.  It is designed to provide as much certainty and continuity as possible for businesses, workers and consumers, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-european-union-withdrawal-bill\"\u003eThe European Union (Withdrawal) Bill\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and convert \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law (as it applies in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e) into domestic law on the day we leave the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e. This means that, as far as possible, the same rules and laws will apply immediately before and immediately after our exit, ensuring a smooth transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill will establish a stable legal framework for our withdrawal from the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e, and provide the basis for our future relationship with the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e.  It will not make substantive changes to policy or establish new legal frameworks in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e, beyond those which are necessary to ensure the law functions properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the Bill’s conversion of \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law into \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e law, many areas of law will not function effectively once we leave the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e, because, for example, they refer to \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e institutions that would no longer be relevant in \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e law.  The Bill will therefore give the Government a power to correct the law in these circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese corrections will be made by statutory instruments made under the powers in the Bill.  The power can only correct deficiencies that come out of the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e’s withdrawal from the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e: the Government cannot change existing laws merely because it disliked them before exit. Changes will need to pass through the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo maximise certainty, the Bill will ensure that any question as to the meaning of \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e-derived law will be determined in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e courts, by reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union’s (\u003cabbr title=\"Court of Justice of the European Union\"\u003eCJEU\u003c/abbr\u003e) case law as it exists on the day we leave the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e.  The Bill will provide that historic \u003cabbr title=\"Court of Justice of the European Union\"\u003eCJEU\u003c/abbr\u003e case law be given the same binding, or precedent, status in our courts as decisions of our own Supreme Court or (in relation to criminal cases in Scotland) the High Court of Justiciary. It is very rare for the Supreme Court to depart from one of its own decisions and we would expect the Supreme Court to only rarely depart from \u003cabbr title=\"Court of Justice of the European Union\"\u003eCJEU\u003c/abbr\u003e case law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill delivers on our promise to end the supremacy of \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e.  It is the only way for the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e to leave the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e while taking back control – so that our future laws will be made in London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Cardiff. \nFor more information, please see our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-about-the-repeal-bill\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBill factsheets\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"for-employers\"\u003eFor employers\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e has a long-standing record of ensuring that employment and equality rights are protected.  The Bill will ensure that workers’ rights which derive from \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law will continue to be available in \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis ensures that rights such as those in the Working Time Directive and the Equality Act 2010 will continue to apply after exit.  This will give certainty and continuity to employees and employers alike, creating stability in which the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e can grow and thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prime Minister has been clear that securing the future status of \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e nationals currently living in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e and \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e nationals living in the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e is a priority for agreement during negotiations, including how \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e business will be able to employ \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e nationals after exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Government has already set out a fair and serious offer outlining how we intend to protect the rights of \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e citizens in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e and \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e nationals in the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, please see our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-about-the-repeal-bill\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efactsheet on Workers’ Rights and Equalities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"consumer-protection\"\u003eConsumer protection\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of the Bill, \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e consumer protections that are based on \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law will be preserved wherever practical, using the preservation powers in the Bill. This means that, when buying from traders in the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e, you will be able to rely on the same rights you have now after we leave the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere rights derived from \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e legislation have been clarified by the \u003cabbr title=\"Court of Justice of the European Union\"\u003eCJEU\u003c/abbr\u003e, the effect of those judgments will be preserved and they will be treated as equivalent to precedent established by the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e Supreme Court. \nThis stability will give businesses and consumers clarity and confidence in their domestic rights and obligations.\nFor more information, please read our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-about-the-repeal-bill\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eConsumer Protection factsheet\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-environment\"\u003eThe environment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe remain committed to safeguarding and protecting the \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e’s long history of environmental protection.

We will also uphold our obligations under international environmental treaties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny future changes to our legislation will be subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny.  We will work closely with communities, environmental organisations and other stakeholders to help build our future plans for environmental protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will make sure we can continue create a healthy environment and strong economy.

The Bill will progress through the following parliamentary stages in order to become an Act of Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the House of Commons - the first opportunity for MPs to debate the principles of the Bill takes place at the second reading stage.  At the end of the debate, the Commons vote to decide whether the Bill should progress to the next stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is followed by the committee stage - during this phase, the Bill is thoroughly examined to ensure each clause is agreed to, changed or removed from the Bill.  Further amendments and votes may occur at report stage, usually swiftly followed by the Bill’s third reading, where the House votes to either approve or reject the final Bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the House of Lords - The Bill is then passed to the House of Lords. Here it will follow a similar series of stages, at the end of which the Bill is returned back to the House of Commons to consider any amendments made by the Lords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRoyal Assent - Before receiving Royal Assent, both the House of Commons and the House of Lords must agree on a version of the Bill. Royal Assent is the Monarch’s formal agreement to make the Bill into an Act and thus become part of \u003cabbr title=\"United Kingdom\"\u003eUK\u003c/abbr\u003e statute law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of changes made by the Bill (including, most notably, the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972) will come into effect on the day we leave the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be a process using secondary legislation (Statutory Instruments) for making corrections to the laws that will not operate appropriately once we have left the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e, along with appropriate Parliamentary scrutiny. This will start shortly after the Bill receives Royal Assent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe power to create SIs which allow corrections to be made is time limited and enacted to ensure a working statute book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeparately, the Government will introduce further Bills over the next session of Parliament to ensure we are prepared for our withdrawal - on, for example, customs, immigration, trade, fisheries, agriculture, international sanctions and nuclear safeguards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will strive to give businesses affected, including small businesses, the time and support they need to prepare.

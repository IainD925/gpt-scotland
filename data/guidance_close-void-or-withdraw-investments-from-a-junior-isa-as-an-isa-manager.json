So if there have been other contributions to the account it will be for the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e provider to agree with the registered contact what is to happen to these. The terms and conditions of the account may require the account to close and the contributions to be sent to the child or they may allow the sums to be moved to a non-Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"void\"\u003eVoid life insurance policies and chargeable events\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs instructs that a Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must be voided, any policies held within the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must terminate, unless they have already been surrendered, matured or paid out on death before the provider discovered that the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must be voided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe policy will terminate in accordance with the contractual terms when it comes to the notice of the account provider that the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must be voided. It does not terminate when the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e first failed the conditions (which may have been at inception or some time subsequently) or when notice of the failure reaches the insurer (unless the insurer is also the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e provider).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the provider is not the insurer, it should notify the insurer of the failure within 30 days of it coming to the provider’s notice that the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must be voided. Notice may be given in writing or in some other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA void policy remains part of the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e business of the insurer throughout its existence, notwithstanding the fact that the conditions to be a qualifying investment in a valid Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e will have been breached at some point during the policy’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe special rules that tax gains on life insurance policies, often known as the chargeable event rules, are used to recover tax relief that is not due on a policy which is held within a Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e which is voided.  The exemption from tax on chargeable event gains held within a Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e does not apply.  Tax liability may arise on the forced termination of the void policy and on any previous chargeable events which took place before the provider learns that the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must be voided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a policy terminates in accordance with the contractual terms when it comes to the notice of the account provider that the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e must be voided.

Where appropriate, the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e provider should account for tax by deducting the amount due from their next claim to HMRC Repayments (see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/annual-returns-and-tax-claims-for-isa-managers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eannual returns and tax claims\u003c/a\u003e).

If the claim is agreed, HMRC will issue a letter to the registered contact letting them know that the funds in the Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e can be withdrawn. The Junior \u003cabbr title=\"individual savings account\"\u003eISA\u003c/abbr\u003e provider should ask for sight of the letter and retain it (or a copy of it).

In most cases the withdrawal will be in cash, but if the provider allows, the investments in the account can be transferred to the registered contact directly. This would be most useful where sale of the investments would attract an early redemption penalty. In such circumstances, the account may be closed, and the total balance withdrawn by the registered contact.

It is designed to help local authorities gain assurance that institutions are administering the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund correctly.\nThis guide will be of interest to local authority chief financial officers, directors of children’s services, heads of children’s services finance and heads of internal audit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important for local authorities to note that this guide is not mandatory. Local authorities must consider the risks to funding and the need for assurance in respect of their own direct provision, including local authority maintained schools with sixth forms, but it is for chief financial officers to determine whether and how any work should be undertaken to enable them to make their grant returns to ESFA. The use of all, part or none of this guide to enable them to do so is entirely at their discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"key-points\"\u003eKey points\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Funds are subject to assurance as part of the normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should ensure they have appropriate processes in place to record bursary applications and awards (including the number, value, purpose, whether awarded or not, and a brief justification for the decision).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis audit guide is designed to sit alongside the  \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2017-to-2018-academic-year\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide for the 2017 to 2018 academic year\u003c/a\u003e which provides more information about bursary fund eligibility and processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this guide is not mandatory, local authorities should familiarise themselves with the audit processes and the error criteria it explains ESFA will use for the 2017 to 2018 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCopies of the working papers used by ESFA in audits are provided as part of this guide. Local authority auditors may wish to use these when assessing if 16 to 19 Bursary Funds have been used appropriately. The working papers are to record any actual payment errors, audit findings and suggestions for improvement identified at audit.  There is also space for the institution’s comments/response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the 2017 to 2018 academic year, ESFA has determined that, when undertaking its own audits of bursary funding, institutions will be given a 5 day grace period in which to resolve any errors the audit identifies. Local authorities may wish to offer institutions this same 5 day grace period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an error is identified and recovery action has not been carried out by the institution, the auditor should contact \u003ca href=\"mailto:jayne.lievesley@education.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eJayne Lievesley\u003c/a\u003e in ESFA’s Student Support team with details.

This will ensure that payments are made in accordance with ESFA requirements set out in the  \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2017-to-2018-academic-year\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide for the 2017 to 2018 academic year\u003c/a\u003e published in March 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA suggests that, where possible, local authorities should consider an integrated approach to individual audits at institutions.  This means undertaking 16 to 19 Bursary Fund audits when they visit an institution to perform audit work in other areas, for example, the funding audit at maintained school sixth forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities can obtain assurance over 16 to 19 Bursary Funding in a number of different ways, for example, controls review/evaluation with walkthrough/compliance testing and/or the substantive testing of individual students. It is entirely at the discretion of individual local authorities which type of audit testing, or combination of testing, they choose to undertake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo assist local authority auditors, ESFA has provided a brief controls questionnaire alongside this document.  This questionnaire sets out the key areas where assurance is needed and can be completed through discussions with the institution. Identified control weaknesses and suggestions for improvement should be reported to the institution by completing the relevant column in the document.  The questionnaire (and other documents noted below) include both bursary funding and free meals in further education though local authorities will not usually need to use the free meals sections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a81d4d540f0b6230269965a/FM___Bursary_Controls_Questionnaire.xlsx\"\u003e\n        \u003csvg class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--spreadsheet\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 99 140\" width=\"99\" height=\"140\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M12 12h75v27H12zm0 47h18.75v63H12zm55 2v59H51V61h16m2-2H49v63h20V59z\" stroke-width=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M49 61.05V120H32.8V61.05H49m2-2H30.75v63H51V59zm34 2V120H69.05V61.05H85m2-2H67v63h20V59z\" stroke-width=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M30 68.5h56.5M30 77.34h56.5M30 112.7h56.5M30 95.02h56.5M30 86.18h56.5M30 103.86h56.5\" fill=\"none\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\n\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a81d4d540f0b6230269965a/FM___Bursary_Controls_Questionnaire.xlsx\"\u003eFree meals and bursary control questionnaire\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003eMS Excel Spreadsheet\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e12.5 KB\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA has also provided a suggested substantive testing programme alongside this document for use by local authorities who decide to undertake this type of testing as part of their audit approach.

The government is committed to transforming the regulatory framework for fire safety in response to the Grenfell Tower fire, bringing about the biggest change in building safety for a generation. We will be introducing our Building Safety Bill this year which will establish a new building safety regime in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3. As a first step, we will introduce a number of new requirements into the planning system (which we refer to as planning gateway one) by making amendments to The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), and an associated instrument. The purpose of the new requirements is to ensure fire safety matters as they relate to land use planning are incorporated at the planning stage for schemes involving a relevant high-rise residential building. \u003ca href=\"#annex-a-planning-gateway-one-information\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDetail on planning gateway one\u003c/a\u003e can be found in Annex A.

In developing the approach to implementing planning gateway one, we have worked with key stakeholders including the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), Joint Regulators Group, the Home Office and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The new legislative requirements, when introduced, will establish HSE as a statutory consultee to provide specialist fire safety advice to local planning authorities. In due course, we expect that role to be fulfilled by the Building Safety Regulator established under the Building Safety Bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e10.

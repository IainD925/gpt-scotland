For most schools, a reasonable starting point to determine your estimated pupil numbers for academic year 2022 to 2023 is your current actual intake. Where schools are expecting new year groups to be occupied within academic year 2022 to 2023, these should be reflected in the return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have included a time series showing your actual pupil numbers and your funded pupil numbers. The form will request further information or evidence if you are adding a year group and the number of pupils in that year group differ from the number recorded on your previous census return. It is important that this is provided in the commentary section of the return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a free text box for institutions to provide specific evidence for individual year group estimates, such as supporting information from the local authority. This may include details of school infrastructure changes in the future, moves to permanent facilities, families and children moving into the area for a new housing development and/or details of additional pupils the local authority has asked you to take. However, if the increase in pupils relates to basic need, this should be funded by your local authority and not reflected in your pupil estimates provided to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"moderation-of-estimated-pupil-numbers\"\u003eModeration of estimated pupil numbers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will review all estimated pupil numbers to ensure they are reasonable and well-evidenced. We will consider the October 2021 school census return, trends in pupil numbers, retention rates, the accuracy of previous estimates and any information you provide. If we have not accepted your figures, we will explain why, and institutions will be given the opportunity to provide further evidence to support their estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere necessary, we will contact institutions in early December to request additional evidence. Following this, there will be a further moderation before final outcomes are confirmed in late January. Further details are provided in the timeline below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pupil-number-adjustments-pna\"\u003ePupil number adjustments (PNA)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInaccurate estimates can cause significant and problematic adjustments to funding allocations. Each year we reconcile estimates with actual pupil numbers, through the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funded-on-estimates\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePNA \u003c/a\u003e exercise. Where this adjustment is positive (for instance, where funded numbers are less than those recorded in the census) it is made in the same academic year. Where funded numbers are higher than those recorded in the census, we will recover funds in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"trusts-that-have-met-the-conditions-in-their-funding-agreement-to-move-to-census-funding\"\u003eTrusts that have met the conditions in their funding agreement to move to census funding\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be that the basis of funding for your academy will change to census for 2022 to 2023. This is because, for most estimate funded institutions, determining the pupil number basis for funding requires certain conditions to be met. These conditions are set out in the funding agreement and in most cases relate to occupancy levels and/or that there are pupils in all expected year groups. We will use the autumn 2021 census to establish if these conditions have been met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the conditions have been met, the academy will move onto the lagged basis of funding methodology which will use the autumn 2021 census to determine the pupil numbers in the general annual grant (GAG) allocation. There is no pupil number adjustment with the lagged methodology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to the RFDC process taking place we do not have the census data to determine whether your basis of funding will be census or estimates. It is, therefore, important that you provide your pupils estimate now as it would be too late to request estimates in time to inform this funding allocation round, after the census has taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be some institutions that will move to lagged census funding after providing estimated pupil numbers via the RFDC. We will confirm whether the basis for funding will be lagged or estimates for all academies within your trust that have these clauses, in December 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"important-dates\"\u003eImportant dates\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe timeline for gathering and confirming 2022 to 2023 estimated pupil numbers is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eDate\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eActivity\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003e27 September 2021\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eRFDC launches – academies and trusts submit estimated pupil numbers\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003e15 October 2021\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eRFDC closes – deadline for submissions\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003eNovember 2021 to January 2022\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eESFA reviews estimated pupil numbers – academies and trusts should expect possible time-limited requests for further information to support pupil numbers\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003eMid-December 2021\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eESFA will notify any academies that will no longer be funded on estimates in academic year 2022 to 2023\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003eEnd of January 2022\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eESFA will confirm agreed estimated pupil numbers – academies and trusts will have 14 days to raise any concerns regarding the agreed outcome\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003eEnd of March 2022\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eESFA will issue academic year 2022 to 2023 funding allocation statements\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact-us\"\u003eContact us\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any questions about this document or the RFDC process, please \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json\u0026amp;redirectlink=%2Fen\u0026amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econtact us.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

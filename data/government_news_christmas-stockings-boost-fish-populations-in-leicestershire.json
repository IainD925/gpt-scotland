The restocking in Leicestershire will provide a welcome boost to the angler experience in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResponsible fishing provides a good opportunity to connect with nature and feel the range of benefits doing so can bring. However, it is important to remember that a valid rod fishing licence is required, and anglers must adhere to fishing byelaws and fishery rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJake Dorey, Fisheries Technical Officer for the Environment Agency, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWhile there is a healthy amount of fish in Leicestershire’s waterways, occasionally a helping hand is needed to restore the natural balance following a pollution incident or decline, or to create new fisheries and opportunities for anglers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe work of our National Fish Farm is funded by income from licence fees, so in the lead up to Christmas it’s great to see the fish farm continuing to produce strong and healthy fish needed for restocking and recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe restocking is part of an annual programme funded by income from rod licence sales. Restocking occurs in winter because water temperatures are low and this minimises any stress on the fish, giving them the best possible survival rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eChristmas is a good time to introduce the fish into rivers, as it enables them to acclimatise to their new surroundings, ahead of their spawning season in the spring. Fish also play a critical role in sustaining a river’s finely-balanced eco-system, so the wider natural environment will also get a festive boost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou need a rod fishing licence to fish for salmon, trout, freshwater fish, smelt or eel with a rod and line in England.

This includes improving habitats for fish, reinvesting money back to facilities and clubs for anglers, tackling illegal fishing and working with partners to encourage more people to give fishing a go.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe Environment Agency’s National Coarse Fish Farm at Calverton remains our principal supply of coarse fish for restocking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

This may mean balancing the effectiveness of different data collection methods against the time and resources needed to carry them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you want to run evaluation yourself or commissioning an external team, you should design your product to collect the data you need. Considering these practicalities will make your evaluation simpler to run:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"develop-your-product-with-evaluation-in-mind\"\u003eDevelop your product with evaluation in mind\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is best practice. Find out what you need to evaluate and make sure you can collect, record and store it in a consistent way over the period of the evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"consider-evaluation-when-getting-ethics-approval\"\u003eConsider evaluation when getting ethics approval\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to follow up with users, especially those who disengaged from your product, you need to have permission to email them. To associate data with the individual, you also need informed consent in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"ensure-the-design-of-the-product-supports-randomisation\"\u003eEnsure the design of the product supports randomisation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe product should support randomisation between users and between events for a single user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-data-collection\"\u003eTypes of data collection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"data-collection-through-the-digital-product\"\u003eData collection through the digital product\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollecting data through the digital product is straightforward but means you cannot collect data on people who have stopped using the product. Some data collection from a digital product, like usage data, can be automatic. This is useful, but only some data can be collected in this way. Other data collection relies on users describing their own behaviour (self-report data), which can be inaccurate or biased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData collection must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (\u003cabbr title=\"General Data Protection Regulation\"\u003eGDPR\u003c/abbr\u003e) – \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eread guidance on \u003cabbr title=\"General Data Protection Regulation\"\u003eGDPR\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. It’s important to know that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusers may not always consent to data collection\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"General Data Protection Regulation\"\u003eGDPR\u003c/abbr\u003e requirements will introduce some bias in your data – for example, the requirement for users of a website to accept cookies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"app-store-data\"\u003eApp store data\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApp stores, or similar services, generally provide some statistics about an app, which you can access easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of people who have downloaded a product is a useful measure of impact. However, people often download an app but never use it, or only use it once. Downloads cannot tell you about longer-term engagement or whether a product is effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApp stores give average user ratings (quantitative data) and access to individual reviews (qualitative data). These provide valuable feedback and will also influence whether someone will download an app. Reviews of your product and rival products can help to inform improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, popular apps are not always the most effective. People leaving reviews may also not be representative of most users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"usage-data\"\u003eUsage data\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can draw data from the usage of your digital product. The data you can collect will depend on how the product has been coded, so think about this when developing your product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommonly available data includes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhen the user accesses the product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat parts of the product they viewed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsage data is good for assessing engagement – unlike downloads, it shows individuals are actually engaging with the product and how they are engaging with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsage data cannot show whether an app is effective. However, usage data can be correlated with outcome data. This can show whether users who access the product more show a greater improvement in the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"data-from-smartphones\"\u003eData from smartphones\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany digital devices record data without the user having to do anything different (passive data collection). This reduces missing data and biases associated with who records data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSmartphones typically have motion sensors and location data, which can be used, for example, to estimate physical activity. These measures are not perfect. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusers may not have the phone with them during exercise\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusers might disable data collection if it impacts on battery usage\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusers may not consent to data collection\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ephones cannot always differentiate between activities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsers may be more likely to consent to data collection if they see a benefit to it – for example, if they are using an app for self-tracking purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"data-from-wearable-devices\"\u003eData from wearable devices\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWearables offer more possibilities for passive data collection. Separate motion sensors may give more reliable data. Watch-like devices may directly measure things like heart rate and blood pressure (physiological indicators). Some devices target specific conditions, like continuous glucometers for diabetes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData collection can still be incomplete – devices may require charging and upkeep and people may not always wear them. Data may also not be accurate – for example, step count data is sometimes unreliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"self-tracking-and-self-report-data\"\u003eSelf-tracking and self-report data\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany digital health products ask the user to input data (active data collection) as part of how they function. For example, if the app is used for self-tracking, users may track:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebehaviours, such as physical activity or diet\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehow they feel, for example with a symptom tracker\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it requires action from the individual, incomplete data collection is a common problem. You could still use this data for your evaluation and also ask users questions directly, separate to the product’s functions. For example, you can ask users:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat they think of your product (to generate quantitative or qualitative data)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto complete standardised questionnaires, for example, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-use-screening-tests\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003equestions specific to your evaluation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions should be informed by your model of how your product works. Ask questions in a clear and neutral manner. It is worthwhile piloting your questions to check they work well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach cannot tell you about the experience of non-users and usually cannot tell you about the lasting effects of your product. For example, does an app to promote physical activity still have an impact 5 years later?\nIf someone stops using a product, this may not mean the product hasn’t worked for them. For example, a \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/running-and-aerobic-exercises/get-running-with-couch-to-5k/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCouch to 5K\u003c/a\u003e user may have stopped using the app because they became a confident and regular runner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"linked-data\"\u003eLinked data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData about users of a digital health product or service may be collected for other reasons – for example, when they attend NHS services in person. This data may be useful for your evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo link data from another source to your evaluation of a digital health product, you need to be able to identify the user of the product with the data collected elsewhere. This has legal and technical challenges, so discuss this with the relevant NHS body and consider what permissions you need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"data-collection-outside-the-digital-product\"\u003eData collection outside the digital product\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes the best way to collect data on an individual is to approach them directly, outside of and separate to the digital health product. For example, it may be possible to send them a questionnaire through contact details they provided or to meet them in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese approaches have problems with response rates but are better at reaching people who have disengaged from the digital product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes you will want to collect more objective data from individuals. This might require specific testing, for example, measuring cotinine levels in saliva to objectively measure smoking behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"choose-your-design\"\u003eChoose your design\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStart by thinking about why you are doing an evaluation. Different types of evaluations answer different questions and may be required at different times. Different types of evaluation can complement each other. You rarely want to do just 1 evaluation over the life of a product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommon reasons for doing evaluations include to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echeck whether your product is effective\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ego through a regulatory process\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einform the development of the product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eunderstand users’ needs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some general points to consider when designing your study:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"choosing-an-approach\"\u003eChoosing an approach\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing an approach often involves compromise. A more complicated study will require more time and resources but will give an answer in which you can have more confidence. A cheaper and quicker evaluation may be less rigorous. \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ukri.org/news/new-framework-on-complex-interventions-to-improve-health/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe Medical Research Council (MRC) has advice on evaluating complex interventions\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be in a situation where you can do something very rigorous relatively cheaply, depending on how your product works, what data is available and other factors. Thinking about evaluation early in your development cycle may allow you to design systems that make evaluations cheaper and easier to do later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese resources divide evaluation approaches into 4 broad categories:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edescriptive\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecomparative\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003equalitative\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eeconomic studies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe guidance \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/choose-evaluation-methods-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eChoose evaluation methods\u003c/a\u003e describes these and will help you choose what sort of evaluation you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"mixing-methods\"\u003eMixing methods\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, some evaluations fall between categories or use mixed methods that combine more than 1 design. For example, you could collect data in a before-and-after study on a large number of participants, and also interview a subset of participants about their experience of using the product. Read more about carrying out a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mixed-methods-study\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMixed methods study\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"independent-evaluations\"\u003eIndependent evaluations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsider \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carry-out-your-evaluation-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewho should carry out the evaluation\u003c/a\u003e. You may want an independent organisation or group to conduct it. Demonstrating independence will give your evaluation more credibility as it avoids potential bias. However, there are added costs and less flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndependent evaluations are more usual when you have a product and want to check it works, and you want to communicate your findings to an external audience. It is rare to use independent evaluations when you are still developing your product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"sampling\"\u003eSampling\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost evaluations involve sampling – collecting data from only some users of your product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou want the participants in your sample to be representative of all users. Usually, the best way to do this is a random sample. A consecutive series of users (for example, everyone who downloads an app between 2 dates) often works like a random sample. In some situations, it will be easier to use a specific group. Consider whether this will introduce any biases in your study – for example, might the selected users like the product more or be more likely to respond to it better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRepresentativeness is less important to some evaluation approaches – for example, many qualitative methods. With these methods, you may want to pick a deliberately diverse sample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"statistical-power\"\u003eStatistical power\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne approach used in quantitative analysis is \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analyse-your-data-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehypothesis testing\u003c/a\u003e. Statistical power is the likelihood of a hypothesis test detecting an effect if there is an effect to detect. For example, if your app really does cause users to smoke fewer cigarettes (in which case your hypothesis is ‘this app helps users to smoke fewer cigarettes’), what is the likelihood of measuring that change? Calculation of statistical power tells you how many product users you need to have information about (for example, information about their smoking before and after using the app) for the test to be reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe size of your sample will affect the statistical power. A power analysis or calculation can help you decide if your sample size is large enough. \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.methods.manchester.ac.uk/themes/experimental-methods/power-calculation/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRead more about power calculations on the University of Manchester website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

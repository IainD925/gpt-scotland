This means that manufacturers only need to consider content that does not originate in the UK or EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis gives manufacturers greater sourcing options, as they can source engine parts in the UK or EU and count both towards the final origin calculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if a UK-made engine that costs £2,000 includes an EU-originating crankshaft and piston worth £500 combined, those EU materials count 25% towards the ‘originating’ content of the engine if it is re-exported to the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"example\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApplied examples of cumulation of processing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHS code: 620520\u003cbr\u003e\nProduct: cotton men’s shirts\u003cbr\u003e\nRule: weaving combined with making-up including cutting of fabric\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rule requires the specific processes set out (weaving, as well as making-up including cutting of fabric) to be carried out in the UK. However, with cumulation of processing, these processes can be divided between the UK and EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the weaving of the fabric could be done in the EU, whilst the making-up of the shirt could be done in the UK.

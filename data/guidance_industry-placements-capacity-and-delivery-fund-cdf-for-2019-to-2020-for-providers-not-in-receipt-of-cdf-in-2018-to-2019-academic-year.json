In response to this feedback, we have identified a series of additional models which can be used to ensure placements are high quality, meaningful and deliverable across different industries, as well as being accessible for all students. The framework comprises models which are applicable to all routes, as well as a number of industry-specific models, as listed below. Therefore we have adapted the principles that providers work to for 2019 to 2020 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA summary of the new models of delivery are listed here, full details are included in the relevant sections below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"applicable-to-all-placements\"\u003eApplicable to all placements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIndustry Placement across 2 employers: A single industry placement (average 350 hours, minimum 315 hours) can be split across 2 employers if needed\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ework taster activities: Students can undertake short work taster activities, of up to 35 hours in total, to help them decide on an area in which to specialise. These can be counted towards a student’s total number of placement hours to meet the minimum of 315 hours\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSEND: A provider’s on-site facilities can now be used for students with Special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) for up to 105 hours where they are occupationally relevant to the student’s field of study. This must be in the best interests of the student and carefully aligned to their learning and development objectives\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYoung Offenders: On site facilities can be used for the full duration of placements for young offenders\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eminimum duration: The minimum duration of 45 days will not be a requirement for 2019 to 2020 academic year delivery. Industry placements should be on average 350 hours with a minimum of 315 hours. Whilst a typical working day on a placement is between 7 to 7.5 hours, the total 315 hours can be delivered at the discretion of the provider in accordance with the needs of the employer and the student (for example, if shorter days are required for those with SEND, part time work or other commitments, or to accommodate different industries working patterns)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"industry-specific-placements-only\"\u003eIndustry specific placements only\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConstruction: Students can now complete a Commercial, Charitable or Community Project for a maximum of 105 hours of their placement, working closely with an external employer to develop appropriate technical skills. The rest of the hours should be spent individually with an external employer to ensure the student gains experience of the workplace working independently from peers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConstruction and Engineering \u0026amp; Manufacturing: Students can now spend a maximum of 105 hours of their total hours within an already established Skills Hub or Training Centre; in such a case, students will then need to complete the remainder of their placement with this same employer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDigital: Students studying a Digital course can now undertake a placement that develops their general Digital knowledge and skills as opposed to those only relevant to their specific specialism\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"fund-package\"\u003eEmployer support fund\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e providers within the South West and West Midlands have been invited to take part in this pilot. We have selected providers in these regions to ensure that there is a good mix of types of areas (for example rural, urban and opportunity areas) plus a mix of employer and provider types. Selecting providers in these regions also allows us to maximise the number of industry placements that are in the pilot to give us the most robust findings. This will allow us to look at the difference the funding makes to provision of industry placements depending on industry, employer and area types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot’s findings will enable us to better support all providers delivering T Levels and industry placements through identifying the impact of additional funding on employers’ willingness to offer placements, gathering evidence on employer costs associated with placements and informing our thinking on how to best deploy future funding. Findings from this pilot will be shared with all providers receiving \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e throughout the academic year 2019 to 2020 and a full evaluation is expected to be published in late 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"employer-support-package\"\u003eEmployer support package\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn employer support package will be developed to support employers throughout the 2019 to 2020 academic year. This will be designed to equip employers with the information and understanding needed to build their confidence and effectively plan and implement high quality placements. We will procure an organisation to develop and implement this package of support alongside industry professionals. The package will include both general and industry-specific guidance, face-to-face workshops, webinars and “on-demand” hands-on support. More information will be available at the beginning of the 2019 to 2020 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industry-placements-policy-framework\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/a\u003e about the updated policy and additional support package being developed is set out in more detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"purpose\"\u003ePurpose\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this information is to detail the arrangements for applying to deliver industry placements through the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e in 2019 to 2020 academic year, for those providers that did not receive an allocation of \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e in 2018 to 2019 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e is to facilitate the build-up of capacity and capability to deliver substantial industry placements (previously referred as work placements) and deliver placements in the 2019 to 2020 academic year. The placements are for students on vocational and technical study programmes at level 2 and level 3. It is recognised that the delivery of significant industry placements as part of T Levels will be a significant step change for the sector. This is why funding is being provided now to help build capacity ahead of the roll out of T Levels, from 2020, which industry placements will be an compulsory part of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e funding is additional to the mainstream allocation, which is based on planned hours for qualifications and employability, enrichment and pastoral (\u003cabbr title=\"Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral\"\u003eEEP\u003c/abbr\u003e) hours. The industry placement must be delivered on top of the usual planned hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second round of funding, the first was for delivery in 2018 to 2019 academic year. The approach to further application rounds for \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e funding for industry placements beyond the 2019 to 2020 academic year has not yet been decided. We strongly advise that providers wishing to deliver T Levels at any time in the future apply for \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e in this round. This will enable them to invest in the capacity and capability to deliver Industry placements as part of T Levels in future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"industry-placement-delivery\"\u003eIndustry placement delivery\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders who are opting in for \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e will be required to deliver an industry placement for 20% of their qualifying funded students.  If, for example, you have 1,000 qualifying students, then we would expect you to deliver at least 200 industry placements in 2019 to 2020 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 2019 to 2020 academic year if providers arrange industry placements for students studying AGQs that have not been used to calculate the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e allocation, to help build their capacity in other curriculum areas/industries, this will count towards the 20% delivery target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow T Levels are confirmed as level 3 programmes we are also increasing our emphasis on level 3 students. Therefore for delivery in 2019 to 2020 academic year we are introducing a requirement to prioritise level 3 placements.

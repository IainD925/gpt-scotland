The Government has set up the scheme in response to Covid-19 to support recovery in the family court and to encourage more people to consider mediation as a means of resolving their disputes, where appropriate. To support this, a financial contribution of up to £500 towards the costs of mediation will be provided, \u003ca href=\"#eligibility\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eif eligible\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFind your local mediator - Family Mediation Council\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-might-mediation-be-of-benefit-to-me\"\u003eWhy might mediation be of benefit to me?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFamily mediation lets you stay in control. Unlike in court, where a judge makes the decisions about child and financial arrangements, in mediation you and the other person/people decide what you agree to and what you don’t. When it comes to your children, mediation can help you put your child’s interest first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation can be less stressful and far quicker than going to court so can be an efficient way of resolving disagreements. If you cannot reach an agreement, you still have the right to go to court. You can also use family mediation after you made an application to the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be difficult for separated parents or other family members in dispute to talk to each other and work together to find solutions. Family mediation provides a safe and supported structure to sort out the best arrangements for children, as well as other considerations such as how to divide assets and money, and where you and your children will live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFamily mediation can also help when circumstances change which means you need to make new arrangements. For example, as children grow up, family mediators can help you agree on changes to arrangements for children without having to go to court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-i-have-to-be-in-the-same-room-as-the-person-i-am-in-mediation-with\"\u003eDo I have to be in the same room as the person I am in mediation with?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn mediation, you can still work to find an agreement without being in the same room or space with the other person  – you don’t have to spend time with the person you are in mediation with if you choose not to. Your mediator can help you find a way to resolve your disagreements without being in direct contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-do-i-apply-for-a-mediation-voucher\"\u003eHow do I apply for a mediation voucher?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt your MIAM, the mediator will discuss the voucher scheme with you if your case might be eligible. You will be offered a ‘voucher’ contribution, subject to suitability, case type and availability of the vouchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"MIAM\"\u003eWhat is a MIAM?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore making a court application for certain types of family law orders, you will be required to attend a Mediation Information Assessment Meeting (MIAM) unless you have a valid \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://apply-to-court-about-child-arrangements.service.justice.gov.uk/about/miam_exemptions\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eexemption\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA MIAM is a short meeting with a qualified mediator where you will be provided with information about mediation as a way of resolving your issues. The mediator will assess whether mediation is an appropriate option based on your individual circumstances. Both parties will need to attend a MIAM before undertaking mediation which can be attended together or separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFind your local mediator - Family Mediation Council\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-i-have-to-pay-for-a-miam-before-i-attend-mediation\"\u003eDo I have to pay for a MIAM before I attend mediation?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you or the other parent/person are eligible for legal aid you both will qualify for a free MIAM (with mediators that carry out legal aid work).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf neither of you are eligible for legal aid, you will have to pay for the MIAM. This is around £120 per person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEstimated fees may vary depending on your location and the experience of the mediator. Some mediators offer reductions if you’re unemployed or on a low income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-legal-aid\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCheck if you might be eligible for legal aid\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-the-mediation-voucher-be-used-to-pay-for-a-miam\"\u003eCan the mediation voucher be used to pay for a MIAM?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the use of the mediation voucher is restricted to assisting with funding of mediation sessions only.

You will not receive a physical voucher and you will not need to make an application for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVouchers are limited in number and will be offered to eligible parties until they are no longer available.

The voucher is intended to be a contribution towards mediation sessions. Your mediator will tell you their rates and how many sessions the voucher is likely to cover. As the total value of the voucher is £500, you may need to contribute to the overall cost of your sessions if you choose to continue with mediation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-i-get-a-voucher-if-i-am-eligible-for-legal-aid\"\u003eCan I get a voucher if I am eligible for legal aid?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, if you are eligible for legal aid you can still be eligible for a voucher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mediation voucher scheme is a one-off financial contribution of up to £500 and will not cover the cost of a MIAM.

This guidance applies to England only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.\tThis guidance sets out the eligibility criteria for the scheme. The guidance does not replace existing legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.\tEnquiries on this measure should be addressed to: \u003ca href=\"mailto:ndr@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003endr@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.\tAt the Autumn Statement on 22 November 2023 the Chancellor announced the extension of the business rates relief scheme for retail, hospitality, and leisure properties, worth an estimated £2.4 billion in 2024/25. This will support the businesses that make our high streets and town centres a success and help them to evolve and adapt to changing consumer demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.\tThe 2024/25 Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Business Rates Relief scheme will provide eligible, occupied, retail, hospitality, and leisure properties with a 75% relief, up to a cash cap limit of £110,000 per business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.\tThis document provides guidance to authorities about the operation and delivery of the policy. The government expects local authorities to include details of the relief to be provided to eligible ratepayers for 2024/25 in their bills for the beginning of the 2024/25 billing cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-will-the-relief-be-provided\"\u003eHow will the relief be provided?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.\tAs this is a temporary measure for 2024/25, the government is not changing the legislation relating to the reliefs available to properties. Instead, the government will, in line with the eligibility criteria set out in this guidance, reimburse local authorities that use their discretionary relief powers under Section 47 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (as amended) to grant relief. It will be for individual local billing authorities to adopt a local scheme and determine in each individual case when, having regard to this guidance, to grant relief under Section 47.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.\tThe G\ngovernment will fully reimburse billing authorities and major precepting authorities for their loss of income under the rates retention scheme as a result of awarding the relief that falls within the definitions in this guidance, using a grant under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e9.\tLocal authorities will be asked to provide an estimate of their likely total cost for providing the relief in their National Non-Domestic Rate Return 1 (NNDR1) for 2024/25. Central government will provide payments to authorities to cover the local share. Local authorities will also be asked to provide outturn data on the actual total cost for providing the relief, via the National Non-Domestic Rate 3 (NNDR3) forms. Any required reconciliations will then be conducted at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e10.\tThe government expects billing authorities to apply and grant relief to qualifying ratepayers from the start of the 2024/25 billing year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"which-properties-will-benefit-from-relief\"\u003eWhich properties will benefit from relief?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e11.\tHereditaments which benefit from the relief will be those which for a chargeable day in 2024/25:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea.\tmeet the eligibility criteria at Part 2,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eand\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eb.\tthe ratepayer for that chargeable day has not refused the relief for the eligible hereditament.  The ratepayer may refuse the relief for each eligible hereditament anytime up to 30 April 2025.  The ratepayer cannot subsequently withdraw their refusal for either all or part of the financial year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e12.\tLocal authorities should make it clear in their approved scheme that, for the purposes of section 47 of the 1988 Act, hereditaments where the ratepayer has refused the relief are outside of the scheme and outside of the scope of the decision of which hereditaments qualify for the discount and are therefore ineligible for the relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e13.\tIn line with the legal restrictions in section 47(8A) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, billing authorities may not grant the discount to themselves, certain precepting authorities (e.g. a parish or county council) or a functional body, within the meaning of the Greater London Authority Act 1999.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-much-relief-will-be-available\"\u003eHow much relief will be available?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e14.\tSubject to the £110,000 cash cap per business, the total amount of government-funded relief available for each property for 2024/25 under this scheme is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea.\tFor chargeable days from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, 75% of the chargeable amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e15.\tThe relief should be applied after mandatory reliefs and other discretionary reliefs funded by section 31 grants have been applied, but before those where local authorities have used their wider discretionary relief powers introduced by the Localism Act 2011, which are not funded by section 31 grants. However, as required in the NNDR guidance notes, the former categories of discretionary relief available prior to the Localism Act 2011 (i.e. charitable/CASC and not for profit) should be applied first in the sequence of discretionary reliefs and, therefore, before Retail, Hospitality and Leisure relief.  Authorities may use their discretionary powers to, at cost to themselves, offer further discounts outside this scheme or additional relief to hereditaments within the scheme. However, where an authority applies a locally funded relief under section 47, this should be applied after the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure relief. The ordering should be applied in following sequence:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eImprovement Relief\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTransitional Relief\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOther mandatory Reliefs (as determined in legislation)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eS.47 Discretionary Relief in the following order:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI.\t2023 Supporting Small Business (SSB)\u003cbr\u003e\nII.\tFormer categories of discretionary relief available prior to the Localism Act 2011 (i.e. charitable, CASC, not for profit) should be applied first in the sequence of discretionary reliefs, after SSB\u003cbr\u003e\nIII.\tOther discretionary (centrally funded) including Freeport relief\u003cbr\u003e\nIV.\t2024/25 Retail Hospitality and Leisure relief scheme\u003cbr\u003e\nV.\tOther locally funded schemes\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e16.\tSubject to the cash cap, the eligibility for the discount and the relief itself will be assessed and calculated on a daily basis. The following formula should be used to determine the amount of relief to be granted for a chargeable day for a particular hereditament in the financial year 2024/25:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmount of relief to be granted = V x 0.75 where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eV is the daily charge for the hereditament for the chargeable day after the application of any mandatory relief and any certain other discretionary reliefs in line with the guidance in paragraph 15 above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e17.\tThis should be calculated ignoring any prior year adjustments in liabilities which fall to be liable on the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e18.\tThe total value of relief available per business, whether occupying one or more properties, is capped at £110,000. Any ratepayer who would be eligible for a sum of relief above £110,000 if there were no cap in place, should be awarded relief up to the full value of £110,000 (as has been the policy for previous years). Ratepayers that occupy more than one property will be entitled to relief for each of their eligible properties, up to a total value of £110,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-cash-cap-and-subsidy-control\"\u003eThe Cash Cap and Subsidy Control\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e19.\tUnder the cash cap, no ratepayer can in any circumstances exceed the £110,000 cash cap across all of their hereditaments in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e20.\tWhere a ratepayer has a qualifying connection with another ratepayer then those ratepayers should be considered as one ratepayer for the purposes of the cash caps.  A ratepayer shall be treated as having a qualifying connection with another:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea.\twhere both ratepayers are companies, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ei.\tone is a subsidiary of the other, or\u003cbr\u003e\nii.\tboth are subsidiaries of the same company; or\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eb.\twhere only one ratepayer is a company, the other ratepayer (the “second ratepayer”) has such an interest in that company as would, if the second ratepayer were a company, result in its being the holding company of the other*.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e*“company” has the meaning given by section 1(1) of the Companies Act 2006.  “holding company” and “subsidiary” have the meanings given by section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e21.\tFurthermore, the Retail Hospitality and Leisure Scheme is likely to amount to subsidy.  Any relief provided by local authorities under this scheme will need to comply with the UK’s domestic and international subsidy control obligations (See the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/subsidy-control-regime\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBEIS guidance for public authorities\u003c/a\u003e which contains guidance and information for the UK subsidy control regime).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e22.\tTo the extent that a Local Authority is seeking to provide relief that falls below the Minimal Financial Assistance (MFA) thresholds, the Subsidy Control Act allows an economic actor (e.g. a holding company and its subsidiaries) to receive up to £315,000 in a three-year period (consisting of the 2024/25 year and the two previous financial years). MFA subsidies cumulate with each other and with other subsidies that fall within the category of ‘Minimal or SPEI financial assistance’. BEIS COVID-19 business grants and any other subsidies claimed under the Small Amounts of Financial Assistance limit of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement should be counted towards the £315,000 allowance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e23.\tIn those cases where it is clear to the local authority that the ratepayer is likely to breach the cash cap or the MFA limit then the authority should automatically withhold the relief.  Otherwise, local authorities may include the relief in bills and ask the ratepayers, on a self-assessment basis, to inform the authority if they are in breach of the cash caps or MFA limit. Part 4 of this guidance contains a sample ratepayer declaration, which local authorities may wish to use to discharge this responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e24.\tMFA subsidies above £100,000 are subject to transparency requirements. This is not cumulated per beneficiary but applies per subsidy award. This means that for every individual subsidy provided of more than £100,000, the local authority needs to include details of the subsidy on the subsidy control database. This can be found at: \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://manageuksubsidies.beis.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehttps://manageuksubsidies.beis.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e.

A new hereditament created as a result of a split or merger during the financial year, or where there is a change of use, should be considered afresh for the relief on that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"recalculations-of-relief\"\u003eRecalculations of relief\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e26.\tThe amount of relief awarded should be recalculated in the event of a change of circumstances. This could include, for example, a backdated change to the rateable value or the hereditament. This change of circumstances could arise during the year in question or during a later year.

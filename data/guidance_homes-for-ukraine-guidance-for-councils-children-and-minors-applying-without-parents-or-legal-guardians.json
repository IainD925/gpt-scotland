It does not replace local council’s statutory duties or responsibilities. It also includes guidance at Annex D on children without their parent(s)/legal guardian in the UK who arrived outside of the ‘eligible minors’ route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils have a critical role in the delivery of the Homes for Ukraine Scheme. Their safeguarding role is particularly important for this cohort of children. In designing the scheme, safeguards have been introduced to reduce risks to children and young people who do not have the protection of being with a parent or legal guardian, although these risks cannot be eliminated entirely. Councils are required to carry out pre- and post-arrival checks and ongoing monitoring of sponsorship arrangements to ensure children are being cared for appropriately. Councils can determine how to deliver the Homes for Ukraine scheme locally and will need to work closely with Children’s Services (particularly Private Fostering teams) to deliver these checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance outlines the role of councils across England in supporting the scheme. The policy principles underpinning this guidance apply across the UK, but because of the different legislative and operational context, there is additional guidance for councils in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/people-arriving-from-ukraine-risk-and-need-public-protection-guidance/pages/unaccompanied-children/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eScotland\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.wales/homes-ukraine-eligible-minors-visa-schemes\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWales\u003c/a\u003e and for Health and Social Care Trusts in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/supporting-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNorthern Ireland\u003c/a\u003e. However, the sections on eligibility criteria and approving sponsors also apply directly to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew applications cannot be made to the super sponsor schemes in Scotland and Wales  (applications received before 15 July 2022 will be considered on a case-by-case basis).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance should be read in conjunction with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/homes-for-ukraine-guidance-for-councils\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHomes for Ukraine Council Guidance\u003c/a\u003e, and related \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/super-sponsor-scheme-and-homes-for-ukraine-guidance-for-local-authorities/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eScottish\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gov.wales/homes-ukraine-advice-and-guidance-local-authorities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWelsh\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/supporting-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNorthern Ireland\u003c/a\u003e guidance, which sets out the general process for Homes for Ukraine arrivals.

This should be followed along with specific guidance on harms such as modern slavery, exploitation, or domestic abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also continue working with other safeguarding partners as usual, including the police and health agencies, as they carry out their statutory safeguarding functions, and share information as necessary. This ensures there is a joint understanding of, and response to, any concerns arising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also wish to engage other relevant agencies and services who are in contact with guest families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Homes for Ukraine Scheme was expanded in July 2022 to allow applicants under the age of 18 years to come to the UK without a parent or legal guardian. The scheme supports eligible minors to safely arrive, and to live and thrive in the UK without their parent or legal guardian, supported by a sponsor that they know and trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe worked with the Ukrainian government, councils, voluntary and community sector partners and other experts in designing the scheme to ensure that robust safeguarding checks are in place to ensure children stay safe while here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProspective sponsors can use the online application form (‘\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://apply-to-offer-homes-for-ukraine.service.gov.uk/sponsor-a-child/start\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eApply to provide a safe home for a child from Ukraine\u003c/a\u003e’) to start their application process and for councils to begin safeguarding checks. The process requires the prospective sponsor to first undergo safeguarding checks before an eligible child can begin their visa application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChildren arriving under this scheme will be able to live in the UK for  up to 18 months . They will have access to education, healthcare, benefits, employment (as appropriate under UK law) and other support. Application criteria are set out below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 19 February 2024, changes were made to the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme eligibility rules. If the minor applied prior to this date, please refer to the section ‘Minors who applied prior to 19 February 2024’ for guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChildren and young people who arrived under the Eligible Minors Scheme will be eligible to apply for further permission to stay in the UK under the Ukraine Permission Extension (UPE) Scheme. Further information will be published in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pre-arrival-checks\"\u003ePre-arrival checks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChildren and any accompanying adults arriving in the UK need to meet standard security checks and enrol biometrics prior to being considered for a visa. The Home Office will run the security checks as part of the sponsorship scheme approval process and report the results back to the council through Foundry. The Home Office will also run the initial criminal records checks against all adults in sponsors’ households.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to Home Office checks, the local authority will undertake eligibility and suitability checks on the prospective sponsors. Councils should process these checks with urgency once they have received a case on Foundry with both forms of parental consent as detailed below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe checks that are completed before a child arrives are the same as those for all Homes for Ukraine sponsors, but will be supplemented by a council-led assessment of the sponsorship arrangements for the child. In carrying out this assessment councils should refer to the relevant \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-minimum-standards-for-private-fostering\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eprivate fostering guidance\u003c/a\u003e which contains details of what may or may not be considered as suitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn England the private fostering framework only applies to children up to 16 (or 18 for children with a disability), and where the child is not being accommodated by a parent or legal guardian (or other person with parental responsibility) or a relative (as defined in the Children Act 1989). However, given the additional vulnerability of this group of children and young people, councils are asked to carry out these assessments for all children entering the UK under this expanded scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"application-process\"\u003eApplication process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe step-by-step application and approval process for new applicants is set out below. Councils should keep sponsors and parents updated on the progress of their application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1. The sponsor should start the process by completing the online application form (\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://apply-to-offer-homes-for-ukraine.service.gov.uk/sponsor-a-child\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eApply to provide a safe home for a child from Ukraine\u003c/a\u003e). As part of this application, the sponsor will need to upload two different forms of parental or legal guardian consent:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea. Proof of parental or legal guardian consent for the child to leave Ukraine notarised by an authority approved by the Ukrainian Government:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ei. If in Ukraine, then this must be certified by either the notary authorities or the Guardianship Service of the city or regional council in Ukraine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eii. If in another country, then this must be certified by the notary authorities in that country or by the Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eb. A completed and signed UK Sponsorship Arrangement Consent Form. The sponsor should not apply without both parental consent forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2. The completed application will create a new case in Foundry and the council will be able to access all of the information provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3. The council initiates their sponsorship suitability assessment and checks (set out in further detail in the Approving Sponsors and Parental Consent sections of this guidance), which include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ea. Confirmation of the content in the parental consent forms, including a phone call/ conversation with the parent to verify information provided \u0026amp; agree ongoing contact (e.g. in the event of breakdown)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eb. DBS checks\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ec. Accommodation suitability check;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ed. Council led assessment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea suitability assessment of sponsorship arrangements;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econfirmation of expectations including in relation to the duration of sponsorship.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewritten confirmation that the prospective sponsor understands the expectations of them, as set out in the sponsor guidance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4. The council will upload results of these checks to Foundry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5. In parallel, UKVI will complete security checks on the prospective sponsor, all other adults in the sponsor’s household, and any adult guests. UKVI will update Foundry with the results of these checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6. After all of the checks have been completed, the council will record on Foundry if the sponsorship is suitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7. If any checks or the sponsorship suitability assessment are not passed, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will contact the sponsor directly to inform them that they do not meet the suitability requirements of the scheme and that applications linked to them cannot progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8. If the applicant or the sponsor withdraws their application at any point during the process, the council should mark the application as withdrawn on Foundry, rather than marking the checks as unsuccessful. The council should only mark the sponsor as having been unsuccessful checks if this is the case, as doing so may impact their ability to sponsor guests in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e9. Where the sponsorship checks are successful and have been recorded as such on Foundry, the status of the accommodation request will show as ‘Pre-Arrival Checks Complete’. This initiates a ‘send acceptance email’ prompt which the council selects to send the Sponsor Certification code. The applicant can then submit a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-visa-under-the-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme#prove-your-identity\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003evisa application\u003c/a\u003e inputting the Sponsor Certification code when prompted, and book an appointment to have their photograph and fingerprints taken at a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003evisa application centre (VAC)\u003c/a\u003e as part of the application. Children under 16 must go to the visa application centre appointment with an adult who is over 18. Children under 5 must attend the appointment to have a photograph taken. They do not need to give their fingerprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e10. The Home Office will complete the necessary visa application checks. At this stage, they will also check the sponsor’s immigration status to confirm they are a British or Irish Citizen or settled in the UK (which means having the right to live in the UK permanently). If the visa is unsuccessful, the Home Office will notify the applicant and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will contact the sponsor directly to inform them that the visa application has been unsuccessful. Where the visa application is successful, the applicant will need to return to collect their visa from the visa application centre before they travel to the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e11. The parent or legal guardian and sponsor must ensure at this stage that safe arrangements have been made for the child’s travel and share these with the council for approval using the template at \u003ca href=\"#annex-c-pre-departure-travel-plan-template\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAnnex C\u003c/a\u003e If the council is content with the travel arrangements, the child can then travel to the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e12. Within 24 hours of a child’s arrival, local councils should carry out an initial visit, consistent with the Private Fostering framework, to confirm the suitability of the living arrangements and establish any immediate welfare needs. The council will give the child information about how to raise any concerns about their arrangement and has a duty to help them if they believe they are at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility-criteria\"\u003eEligibility criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"applicant-eligibility--immigration-requirements\"\u003eApplicant eligibility – immigration requirements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe eligibility requirements for children who are not travelling with or joining a parent or legal guardian are set out below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"nationality\"\u003eNationality\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe children:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eMust have an immediate family member who is Ukrainian.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eMust have been residents in Ukraine before 1 January 2022 or have been born after that date.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCan apply from Ukraine or from any other country except the UK.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be assessed by UKVI.

The council should look for evidence that there is a suitable, pre-existing relationship between the sponsor and the parent or legal guardian. This evidence could be in the form of letters or emails, photos, or social media activity from before the start of the conflict on 24 February 2022. Councils can exercise discretion in exceptional circumstances if they judge this to be in the best interests of the child. In exercising this discretion councils may wish to consider, for example, whether the child will be accompanied by an adult relative who will be staying with them and their sponsor for the duration of their time in the UK.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe sponsor must have agreed to host the child for the full 18 months of their permission to stay in the UK, or until they turn 18 and have been hosted for at least 6 months, whichever is sooner.

Where a child is leaving sponsorship to move in with a close family member(s) only, the council should record the child as having left sponsorship on Foundry.

The action to be taken would be dependent on the circumstances and the age of the child. Where appropriate (i.e. where the child is not deemed to be at risk), every effort should be made to reconcile the arrangement. If that is not possible, the council should engage the parent or legal guardian to determine if any alternative arrangements can be made for their child. If the parent or legal guardian cannot be reached or cannot identify alternative arrangements, the council would need to consider their statutory duties, including whether it is necessary to accommodate that child or take them into care.

The sponsor will still need to alert the council that the sponsorship arrangement has ended. While parental or legal guardian consent is not required, the sponsor and council should seek to notify the parent or legal guardian that their child has now left the sponsorship arrangement where possible. The parent or legal guardian may also wish to end the sponsorship arrangement.

In all cases, councils will need to formally agree the rematch and undertake the necessary checks before the guest can move in. Guidance to sponsors of children makes clear that they should let the council know as early as possible (ideally at least 2 months before) where a minor they are sponsoring is due to turn 18 and move out of their accommodation, so the council has sufficient time to discuss next steps with the minor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"alternative-arrangements\"\u003eAlternative arrangements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShould a sponsorship arrangement break down for a child, and a parent or legal guardian cannot be reached or cannot identify another suitable sponsor for their child, or make alternative arrangements, then the council will need to take further action in line with their statutory duties which could include accommodating the child under Children Act 1989 powers or taking the child into care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs set out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-protection-working-with-foreign-authorities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for councils on working with foreign authorities\u003c/a\u003e, where a child is a national of another country, the council should inform the relevant Embassy at the earliest possible opportunity when a child with a connection to a foreign country is made the subject of a child protection plan, has required immediate protection, or is made subject to care proceedings.

However, councils may consider any factors they deem relevant to assess whether accommodation is suitable, enabling flexibility at a local level to deal with individual cases on their merits. Councils continue to retain powers and duties set out in the Housing Act 2004. This guidance does not replace or affect that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf, on checking the accommodation a council decides that it is unsafe and/or unsuitable, we recommend that they speak with the owner of the property about changes that could be made to remedy any issues before deeming the property unsuitable. This should be based on a pragmatic approach. The government would encourage councils to support sponsors – particularly those that do not usually house guests or let out their property to tenants - to bring their properties to an appropriate standard where possible, for example, by working with the Fire Service to supply additional smoke alarms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils retain the discretion to use their enforcement powers to require that issues are remedied if they judge that this is necessary and proportionate. For example, councils could undertake a risk assessment using the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and use their range of enforcement powers (e.g. Hazard Awareness Notices, Improvement Notices etc).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"supporting-post-arrival-and-ongoing-checks\"\u003eSupporting post-arrival and ongoing checks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils are also expected to take responsibility for post-arrival and ongoing visits. Within 24 hours of a child’s arrival the council should carry out an initial visit, consistent with private fostering requirements, which also confirms the suitability of the living arrangements and establishes any immediate welfare needs. The council will give the child information  about how to raise any concerns, and how they have a duty to help them if they believe they are at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSubsequent visits are needed to ensure that the arrangements continue to be satisfactory and, in the child’s, best interest. This includes in cases where a child is 16- or 17-year-olds, and/or where they are accompanied by an adult relative. These ongoing visits should be in line with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-minimum-standards-for-private-fostering\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for Private Fostering\u003c/a\u003e (i.e. at intervals of not more than 6 weeks for the first year, and at intervals of not more than 12 weeks in subsequent years). In all cases local authorities will want to consider whether there are circumstances that might deem more frequent visits necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe format of these visits should be in accordance with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-minimum-standards-for-private-fostering\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePrivate Fostering guidance\u003c/a\u003e.When conducting these visits, it is important that the council spends some of the time speaking to the child, the sponsor and any accompanying adult relative individually to enable them to speak more openly about any challenges they are experiencing living with each other. Where possible, efforts should be made to include the parent/legal guardian in these ongoing visits by arranging for them to dial into the meeting remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese visits help determine that the arrangement continues to be in the best interests of the child, and should consider the child’s age and needs, including language skills. Where a child is approaching their 18th birthday, the council should use these visits to discuss their next steps, including for study, work and possibly moving into their own accommodation, if that is what they want. You should explain that the council will continue to support them as they transition to adulthood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"education-and-childcare-in-england\"\u003eEducation and childcare in England\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust like families entering UK under the Afghan and Hong Kong BN(O) resettlement schemes, children arriving from Ukraine will have no specific additional priority for admission, but the council is under a duty to offer advice to parents or legal guardians on the school application process and should advise them where vacancies exist and how to apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there are school places available in the local area, even if not in the immediate vicinity of the family’s home, the council should work with sponsor and or adult relative of the child(ren) arriving from Ukraine to enable the children to attend school as soon as possible. It is expected that councils provide places and, where they can admit above their published admission numbers (PAN); admitting children of Ukrainian refugees as exceptions to the infant class size limit; as well as place such children using the in-year Fair Access Protocol where needed, as permitted by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSchool Admissions Code\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll young people in England are required to continue in education or training until their 18th birthday and most continue until the end of the academic year in which they turn 18. Councils have a statutory duty to support 16- and 17-year-olds to move into education and training. Guests living in the UK under Ukraine Family Scheme, or the Local Sponsorship Scheme for Ukraine are eligible to enrol as a student, although colleges (but not state-funded schools) may ask to see evidence of eligibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government is providing additional funding to councils to provide education services for children from families if they have arrived through the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"administering-payments-to-sponsors\"\u003eAdministering payments to sponsors\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe sponsor will have the option to receive a monthly thank you payment  for the duration of the child’s Homes for Ukraine visa permission (up to 3 years).

However, councils must ensure that they adhere to the following conditions of payment:\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOnly the named lead sponsor is eligible for the monthly ‘thank you’ payment.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLead sponsors can claim for up to 3 years (in line with the length of the Homes for Ukraine visa – which will be either 18 months or 3 years).

Councils should make sure that this is clearly understood by the sponsor and that they understand who they should report any change of circumstances to. Where other property or safeguarding checks are occurring, these can be combined with verifying that they guest still remains at the property. Councils will be provided with a sponsor declaration form template to support councils to ensure they proactively confirm that sponsors understand this requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere guests move out before the sponsorship period, the sponsor is eligible to claim the monthly payment if the guest has lived in their accommodation for at least half of the month of departure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"identifying-where-rent-is-being-charged\"\u003eIdentifying where rent is being charged\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils should ask the sponsor and guest whether rent is being charged and whether the guest is being asked to provide contributions to food or utilities. With regards to sponsors of children, the council would need to check this with the parent or legal guardian and any accompanying relative who might be paying rent and/or contributing to food/utilities on behalf of the child. Councils should use their discretion to assess whether these contributions are excessive and, if they constitute rent in practice, councils can decline to make the thank you payment. Councils are responsible for the prevention of fraud of the monthly payment at a local level and this should be conducted in line with usual fraud prevention activities. Costs of counter-fraud activity related to the operation of the scheme are covered within the tariff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is recommended that councils conduct a 10% sample of monitoring checks for these payments.

For example, councils will not be asked to source initial accommodation under this scheme as this will be provided by the sponsor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government is also providing funding for councils to administer the ‘thank you’ payments at the relevant monthly rate. We allocate additional funding for these payments through a ringfenced grant, and we expect councils to cover administration costs within the tariff. There are also conditions attached to this grant. Further details on the grant conditions are outlined below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department will make regular payments to councils, each covering 3 months of the programme, in arrears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePayments are based on the actual number of Homes for Ukraine guests and the actual number of payments to sponsoring households (for the monthly ‘thank you’ payments) within each area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn England, in two tier areas, both districts and counties have access to funds for their relevant duties under the scheme.

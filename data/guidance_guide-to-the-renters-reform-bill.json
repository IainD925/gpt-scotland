It will legislate for reforms set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-fairer-private-rented-sector\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eprivate rented sector white paper\u003c/a\u003e published in June 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA healthy private rented sector is a vital part of our housing market - providing much-needed flexibility and in many cases serving as a stepping stone towards home ownership. The overall number of privately rented properties has doubled since 2004 - peaking in 2016 and remaining roughly stable since. For the most part, the sector works well for both landlords and tenants. However, some renters face a precarious lack of security as a result of section 21 evictions. Short notice moves worsen children’s educational outcomes, make it challenging to hold down stable employment, and prevent families putting down roots and investing in their local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNearly a quarter of private rented homes do not meet basic decency standards. The tragic death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak shone a light on the unacceptable state of this damp, cold and dangerous housing - but these problems are not limited to the social rented sector. The government intends to tackle these issues in the private rented sector by legislating to apply a Decent Homes Standard. These dilapidated homes are costing the NHS an estimated £340 million per annum and are holding back local areas, making them less attractive places to live and work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResponsible landlords face challenges too - including when evicting tenants who wilfully do not pay rent or exhibit anti-social behaviour. They also suffer by being undercut by a minority of criminal landlords. Reforms aim to celebrate the overwhelming majority of landlords who do a good job and give them peace of mind that they can repossess their property when a tenant is behaving badly, or their circumstances change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"overview-of-bill-measures\"\u003eOverview of Bill measures\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Renters (Reform) Bill will improve the system for both the 11 million private renters and 2.3 million landlords in England. Our reforms have been developed in consultation with landlord and tenant groups over the past five years.

This will provide tenants with greater security, supporting them to put down roots in their community, whilst ensuring landlords remain confident that they can regain their property where they need to. Renters will also feel empowered to challenge the small minority of landlords who provide poor quality housing without the worry of  eviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve this, the Renters (Reform) Bill will end fixed-term tenancies and move to “rolling” periodic tenancies. This will provide greater security for tenants while retaining the important flexibility that privately rented accommodation offers. Tenants will be able to stay in their home until they decide to end the tenancy by giving 2 months’ notice or the landlord can evidence a valid ground for possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTenants won’t be able to end a tenancy within the first six months, unless the landlord agrees they can. After this, they can end the tenancy at any point, enabling tenants to move more easily when their circumstances change, for example to take up a new job opportunity, or the landlord is not fulfilling their obligations. Landlords won’t be able to use grounds for moving in, selling or redevelopment for the first 6 months of the tenancy, meaning responsible renters will enjoy enhanced security after moving into a property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the absence of section 21, it is critical that landlords have the peace of mind that they can regain their property when their circumstances change or tenants do not fulfil their obligations. Currently, many landlords struggle to recover properties when faced with anti-social behaviour and wilful non-payment of rent, and struggle to navigate the legal landscape. The Bill will introduce comprehensive, fair and efficient grounds to ensure landlords have confidence they can regain possession when it is reasonable. We will expedite landlords’ ability to evict those who disrupt neighbourhoods through anti-social behaviour and introduce a new ground for persistent rent arrears. We will also ensure landlords are able to sell or move into their property if needed, and that the student market is protected through bespoke grounds\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce section 21 is abolished, we need to ensure tenants do not face backdoor evictions, including through egregious rent rises designed to force them out. Nothing, however, in the Bill restricts landlords from raising rents to market value during a tenancy. This will require a landlord to complete a simple form - which we will publish on gov.uk – and serve this to the tenant. Tenants who receive a rent increase that they feel is not representative of the market value will be able to challenge the increase in the First-tier Tribunal. We will issue guidance on this process to ensure that it is clear for everyone. As now, landlords will be allowed to increase rents to market price for their properties and an independent tribunal will make a judgement on this, if needed. To avoid fettering the freedom of the judiciary, the tribunal will continue to be able to determine the actual market rent of a property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-grounds-for-possession\"\u003eThe grounds for possession\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have undertaken a full review of existing grounds for possession, informed by the government consultation, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-new-deal-for-renting-resetting-the-balance-of-rights-and-responsibilities-between-landlords-and-tenants\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eA new deal for renting\u003c/a\u003e, which received almost 20,000 responses and subsequent engagement with stakeholders. The grounds cover all circumstances under which a landlord might reasonably expect possession.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the small proportion of tenancies where court action is required, landlords will need to provide evidence to the judge that the selected ground is met. Grounds can be either mandatory or discretionary. For mandatory grounds, judges must award possession when a landlord can evidence the ground is met. Discretionary grounds allow a judge to consider whether it is reasonable to award possession, even where the ground is met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have introduced of new grounds to support vital, specialist sectors. These allow repossession where it is critical that supply is available for new tenants, such as in temporary accommodation and agriculture, or where it would not be safe or viable to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"table-1-reformed-grounds-for-possession\"\u003eTable 1: Reformed grounds for possession\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eGround\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eExplanation\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eNotice period\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eMandatory or discretionary\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMoving in\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe landlord or their close family member wishes to move into the property.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSelling\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe landlord wishes to sell the property.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSelling (rent-to-buy)\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe landlord is a private registered provider of social housing and there is a rent-to-buy agreement.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMortgage repossession\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe property is subject to a mortgage and the lender exercises a power of sale requiring vacant possession.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSuperior lease ending\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eA social or agricultural landlord’s lease is under a superior tenancy that is terminated by the superior landlord.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSuperior lease ending\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe landlord’s lease is under a superior tenancy that is more than 21 years and is coming to an end\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePossession by superior landlord\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAfter a superior tenancy ends, the superior landlord of a social housing provider or agricultural tenant becomes the tenant’s direct landlord, and seeks to take possession.\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePossession by superior landlord\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAfter a superior lease of more than 21 years ends, the superior landlord becomes the tenant’s direct landlord and seeks possession\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e2 months\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMandatory\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eStudent accommodation\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eIn the 12 months prior to the start of the tenancy the property has been used to house students.

That is why the Renters (Reform) Bill will allow landlords to require insurance covering pet damage.  This will provide landlords with reassurance that any damage caused by a pet can be taken care of, and that the responsibility for preventing and resolving damage caused by a pet will fall to the tenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will publish guidance for landlords and tenants before the new rules come into effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"renting-with-pets-frequently-asked-questions\"\u003eRenting with pets: frequently asked questions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"what-is-it-reasonable-for-a-landlord-to-refuse-a-tenant-having-a-pet\"\u003eWhat is it reasonable for a landlord to refuse a tenant having a pet?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLandlords will be required to fully consider all requests on a case-by-case basis.

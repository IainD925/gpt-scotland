It may also mean you cannot finalise an application for a new document. These may be acceptable reasons to provide alternative evidence of identity or nationality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach case will be considered individually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll need to provide sufficient evidence of your inability to produce the required document due to coronavirus restrictions. For example, you would need to provide evidence of an embassy closure, such as a letter from the relevant national authority, or a link to an official webpage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll also need to provide alternative evidence of your identity and nationality. These can include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edocuments previously issued by the Home Office\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean expired passport or other required document\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean official document issued by the authorities of your country of origin or of the UK which confirms your identity and nationality\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther information can be found in the ‘Alternative evidence of identity’ paragraphs on pages 35 to 36 of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/processes-and-procedures-for-eea-documentation-applications\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eProcesses and procedures for EEA documentation applications guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-your-continuous-residence-in-the-uk-has-been-affected\"\u003eIf your continuous residence in the UK has been affected\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour continuity of residence will not necessarily be affected if you were impacted by coronavirus restrictions. For example, if you had coronavirus overseas and could not return to the UK, or imposed travel restrictions meant you were absent from the UK (providing the period does not exceed 12 months).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"absences-from-the-uk-of-up-to-6-months-in-any-12-month-period\"\u003eAbsences from the UK of up to 6 months in any 12-month period\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour continuity of residence will not be broken regardless of reason if you have been outside the UK for no more than 6 months in a 12-month period, in a single absence or multiple absences.

The EEA Regulations allow for a single absence up to 12 months for an important reason, including serious illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a student who was studying in the UK and are studying outside the UK because of coronavirus, that absence would not cause you to break your continuous residence in the UK for the purposes of acquiring a right of permanent residence, where it is for a single period of more than 6 months but not more than 12 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn absence or absences of more than 6 months but not more than 12 months in total in any continuous 5-year period of residence where coronavirus was not a factor will still interrupt your continuity of residence unless there was another important reason for the absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-isolating will only be considered an important reason for absence if you are, or were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eunder quarantine conditions, for example, when ill with coronavirus yourself\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esharing a house with someone ill with coronavirus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erequired to self-isolate as a result of being, or being in contact with someone who is, in a vulnerable or high-risk category\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn all cases where you have been prevented from travelling due to coronavirus you should provide a supporting letter with your application outlining the details and the dates you were ill or were in quarantine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re only permitted a single absence exceeding 6 months (but not exceeding 12 months) for an important reason in any 5-year continuous residence period.  More than one such absence will always interrupt your continuous residence in the UK regardless of the reason for it, including if you’re prevented from returning to the UK because of coronavirus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"absence-of-more-than-12-months\"\u003eAbsence of more than 12 months\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do not already have permanent residence status under the EEA Regulations, an absence from the UK of more than 12 months will always interrupt your continuity of residence. In these circumstances you’ll need to restart your continuous residence period by 31 December 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"furloughed-workers\"\u003eFurloughed workers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re an EEA national worker who is, or was, furloughed (temporarily relieved of your normal work duties or responsibilities under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme) as a result of the coronavirus public safety restrictions, you’ll continue to be treated as being in work during this period if you both:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewere in genuine and effective employment immediately prior to being furloughed, and\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eremained under contract with your employer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you meet these criteria, any time spent on furlough will be treated as time spent in work and will not break your continuity of lawful residence in the UK. You should provide evidence of this in support of your application for documentation in the form of letters from your employer, DWP or HMRC confirming payment of salary during the period of furlough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis does not apply if you have been made involuntarily redundant as a result of coronavirus but you may be considered under the ‘retention of worker or self-employed status’ below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"retention-of-worker-or-self-employed-status\"\u003eRetention of worker or self-employed status\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re an EEA national worker or self-employed person you may retain that status where you’re temporarily unable to work as a result of illness or accident. If you were unable to work or engage in self-employed activities because you were ill with coronavirus you should provide medical evidence such as a doctor’s letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis also includes job loss specifically as a result of coronavirus restrictions but where you were not ill with coronavirus yourself. You should provide evidence, such as a letter from your employer, confirming the reasons for your involuntary unemployment. You will not need to provide evidence that you’re registered with a Jobcentre Plus and actively seeking work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf, however, your job loss is for reasons unrelated to coronavirus you must refer to the ‘Retaining worker or self-employed person status’ on pages 23 to 26 of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-economic-area-nationals-qualified-persons\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEEA nationals qualified persons guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"self-sufficiency-and-access-to-benefits\"\u003eSelf-sufficiency and access to benefits\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder normal circumstances, a person who is self-sufficient would not normally be permitted to rely on benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you have a temporary interruption in availability of funds as a result of coronavirus restrictions and need to rely on benefits in the short term, then this should not directly lead to a refusal of an application for documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to provide evidence, such as DWP letters, that the temporary period of claiming benefits ceased quickly after any restrictions preventing you accessing available funds were lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe requirement for a self-sufficient person to hold comprehensive sickness insurance is not affected by this temporary exemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

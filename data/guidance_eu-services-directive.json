One way of doing this is by the removal of unjustifiable barriers to service provision. All requirements (for example authorisation schemes and registration processes) which are imposed on service providers must be screened to ensure that they are for example non-discriminatory, necessary and proportionate. Any requirements that cannot be justified under the terms of the Directive will need to be amended or abolished in order to be compliant with the Directive. Any requirements that can be justified under the terms of the Directive must be reported on by \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Business Innovation and Skills\"\u003eBIS\u003c/abbr\u003e to the EU Commission by the 28 December 2009.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDocument 2 below will show you whether legislation in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland has been screened and justified under the terms of the Directive or will be amended to comply with the Directive. Later in the year we will update the website with those authorisation schemes, authorisation scheme procedures or other requirements that government views are not justified together with the amendments that are being made as a result to legislation. Please look out for this information, so that you are aware of how you may have to change your processes – we shall ensure that your Primary Liaison Point (\u003cabbr title=\"Primary Liaison Point\"\u003ePLP\u003c/abbr\u003e) is kept informed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"action-for-competent-authorities\"\u003eAction for competent authorities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou now need to check if your procedural rules or other requirements placed on service providers within scope comply with the Directive. The following flowcharts are designed to assist you with this process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first flowchart is for the screening of authorisation schemes that are imposed on service providers who want to establish in the UK.

Where this is the case, competent authorities should look for the relevant legislation in Document 2 - it should already have been screened and a decision made by the responsible department as to whether it is justified or if amendments are needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have responsibility for imposing your own requirements and authorisation schemes, or the relevant legislation is not shown on our list, then you will have to screen your requirements as explained in the flowcharts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome different considerations pertain to requirements applying to service providers seeking to establish in the UK, as opposed to those who want to provide services in the UK but do not want to establish in the UK. You should refer to the Services Directive Regulations, in particular regulations 14.1 to 14.2, 22.1 to 22.3 and 24.1 to 24.3, in order to ascertain the requirements applicable to each element of an authorisation scheme or other requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne point to note is that the test for necessity is narrower in relation to service providers who are not seeking to establish in the UK. For such service providers, a ‘necessary’ requirement can only be justified on one or more of four specified grounds: public policy, public security, public health or protection of the environment. The specific meanings of these terms have been established by European case law; refer also to Recital 41 of the Directive. However, where a service provider intends to establish in the UK a ‘necessary’ requirement may be justified on wider grounds, by an ‘overriding reason relating to the public interest (ORRPI). This term is defined in Article 4(8) and explained fully in Recital 40 of \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32006L0123\u0026amp;from=EN\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEU Service Directive Final Text 12 December 2006\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease note that regulation 24 is not applicable to professional bodies already complying with the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications (MRPQ) Directive.

This guidance is aimed at those bodies who set rules or requirements which service providers have to comply with, and those who are involved in authorising service providers (ie ‘competent authorities’). These bodies include government departments, devolved administrations, local authorities, licensing and authorisation bodies and other authorities such as professional bodies or bodies who maintain required registers or deliver required training qualifications. The guidance contains user friendly flowcharts which will guide you through the steps that you need to take, and point you to the sections of the guidance that you will need to look at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"screening-flowcharts-for-government-departments\"\u003eScreening flowcharts for government departments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Business Innovation and Skills\"\u003eBIS\u003c/abbr\u003e has been working with government departments and devolved administrations to ensure that national legislation is compliant with the Services Directive.

All requirements (for example authorisation schemes, licence applications, certification, registration processes, approval systems and continuing requirements) that are imposed on service providers must be screened to ensure that they are for example non-discriminatory, necessary and proportionate.

You should refer to the Provision of Services Regulations (which implement the Directive, see below) , in particular regulations 14.1 to 14.2, 22.1 to 22.3 and 24.1 to 24.3, in order to ascertain the requirements applicable to each element of an authorisation scheme or other requirement. One point to note is that the test for necessity is narrower in relation to service providers who are not seeking to establish in the UK. For such service providers, a ‘necessary’ requirement can only be justified on one or more of four specified grounds: a fundamental threat to public policy, public security, public health or protection of the environment. The specific meanings of these terms have been established by European case law; refer also to Recital 41 of the Directive (see link below). However, where a service provider intends to establish in the UK a ‘necessary’ requirement may be justified on wider grounds, by an ‘overriding reason relating to the public interest’ (ORRPI).

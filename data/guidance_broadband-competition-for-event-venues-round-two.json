Applicants can apply for a portion of £200,000 funding towards the costs of digital infrastructure for their venues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK government is committed to supporting the business events industry’s recovery from COVID-19. This scheme offers the chance for venues to boost their digital infrastructure and, in turn, produce stronger bids to secure future international events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis funding is in addition to support available through the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitbritain.org/event-support-programme-overview\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBusiness Events Growth Programme\u003c/a\u003e.

We are also allowing venues to demonstrate involvement in plans to bid for international events in the next five years, rather than the next year only (which was required during the first round of the competition). Applicants who applied for first round funding but were not successful and now feel they meet the new eligibility criteria are welcome to apply for second round funding by submitting a new application. All applicants will be treated equally and first round funding applications will not be considered or relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK government is aware that one of the key factors in choosing a destination for hosting events is the quality of infrastructure, with digital connectivity playing a key role. This competition targets venues with conference facilities that traditionally bid for – or plan to bid for – events which attract international delegates. For the purpose of this competition, an ‘international event’ is one where at least 30% of the total delegates/visitors attending in person are international (non-UK) visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will fund a number of projects with a combined total of £200,000. Exact costs will vary between locations, however the average value per project will be approximately £30,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDCMS reserves the right to fund projects below or exceeding £30,000 based on the relevant project costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDCMS reserves the right not to allocate all of the funding in the event that there are insufficient qualifying event venues to take up all of the funding. Each winner will receive a portion of the £200,000 fund (subject to the additional conditions set out below).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col class=\"steps\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe procurement opportunity should be competed on the open market in accordance with relevant procurement law where applicable.

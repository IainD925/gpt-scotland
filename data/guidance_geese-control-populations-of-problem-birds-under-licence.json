As the birds can’t fly at this time, you can catch them by constructing a pen and a funnel and moving the birds towards it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-cull\"\u003eWhen to cull\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should cull geese shortly after they’ve moulted their main wing feathers as they’ll be unable to fly for 3 to 4 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis usually occurs between the end of May and the end of June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"where-to-cull\"\u003eWhere to cull\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGeese usually choose to moult near water. You can identify moult sites as there will normally be a large number of feathers found at the shoreline or on nearby land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShortly before you carry out the cull, you should visit the site to check that the birds aren’t able to fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"prepare-the-funnel-and-holding-pen\"\u003ePrepare the funnel and holding pen\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should place the funnel and pen at a location which is regularly used by the geese to enter and exit the water. If possible, set up the funnel and pen at least a day before the cull is due to take place, so that the birds can get used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse wire mesh and stakes to create the 2 arms of the funnel. These should run from the water’s edge to the entrance of the holding pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should build the holding pen at the end of the arms of the funnel. It should be large enough to hold the size of the expected catch. Cover the outside of the pen with sacking or similar material so that the birds won’t be alarmed by human presence when they’re inside the pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"catch-the-geese\"\u003eCatch the geese\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRounding-up the geese should take place at first light, although several catches can take place at different sites throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll need at least 6 people for a small catch.

Continue to move the birds into the pen and close the gate once they’re inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLeave the birds alone for a while to allow them to calm down.

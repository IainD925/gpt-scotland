While you will undoubtedly have fun in the sun, a tour here will be operationally focused for most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are important jobs to do, which will require commitment and dedication. We are quite a long way from home, some of the accommodation is pretty old and we can’t replicate all of the health and social welfare facilities available in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are many compensations, great weather for most of the year, plenty of opportunities for sport, hobbies and adventurous training, and many interesting places to visit. There is much for everyone, no matter what age or inclination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cyprus-a-quick-guide\"\u003eCyprus: a quick guide\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you’ve been here before, there’s always a new world to discover. Cyprus lies at the crossroads of three continents, where east meets west and a new experience awaits for you under the sun every day. Where championship golf courses, inviting beaches, and breathtaking mountain trails lie around luxurious hotels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"history-of-cyprus\"\u003eHistory of Cyprus\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCyprus was the site of early Phoenician and Greek colonies. For centuries its rule passed through many hands. It fell to the Turks in 1571 and a large Turkish colony settled on the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn World War I, at the outbreak of hostilities with Turkey, Britain annexed the island. It was declared a Crown colony in 1925. The Greek population, which regarded Greece as its mother country, sought self determination and union (enosis) with Greece. In 1955 a guerrilla war against British rule was launched by the National Organisation of Cypriot Combatants (\u003cabbr title=\"National Organisation of Cypriot Combatants\"\u003eEOKA\u003c/abbr\u003e). In 1958 Greek Cypriot nationalist leader Archbishop Makarios began calling for Cypriot independence rather than union with Greece. During this period Turkish Cypriots began demanding that the island be partitioned between the Greek and Turkish populations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCyprus became an independent nation on August 16, 1960, after Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed on a constitution, which excluded both the possibility of partition as well as of union with Greece. Makarios became the country’s first president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFighting between Greek and Turkish Cypriots flared up in the early 1960s and a \u003cabbr title=\"United Nations\"\u003eUN\u003c/abbr\u003e peacekeeping force was sent to the island in 1965.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"moving-to-cyprus\"\u003eMoving to Cyprus\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unaccompanied-baggage\"\u003eUnaccompanied baggage\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as possible after receiving your posting authority it is advisable to contact your unit quartermaster department or PD clerk regarding the shipment of your unaccompanied baggage. They will confirm your allowance and entitlements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to complete F/Mov/713A prior to the collection of your unaccompanied baggage and a customs form to enable you to import your personal goods into Cyprus. Don’t be alarmed by this form, you should only list major electrical goods and furniture you will be sending eg. fridge freezer, three piece suite, microwave etc,  given that your cubic capacity limits what you can bring. The excess charge per cubic metre over your limit is expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHousehold furniture and other articles which you do not wish to bring can be stored in the UK at public expense. A removal service does operate in Cyprus, however the capacity is greatly reduced compared to that for a move within Europe. Although you might have been advised that it takes six weeks from time of collection to time of delivery, previous experience has shown that eight weeks is a more sensible timescale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Europe there is no requirement to give a quarter address in Cyprus prior to shipment. All unaccompanied baggage received at the Port Unit in Limassol will be stored until your arrival. Please refer to the baggage scales (entitlements) at Annex F.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnsure your movements clerk submits the appropriate F Mov forms to DPRC London.\u003cbr\u003e\nContinuity post personnel (HQ UNFICYP only) have an alternative travel option (see below).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"storage\"\u003eStorage\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComplete an F/Mov/713 form and return it to your unit families office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eM\u0026amp;S shipping will contract a civilian storage firm to collect and store the remainder of your personal belongings and household contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-you-need-to-bring-with-you\"\u003eWhat you need to bring with you\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-to-bring\"\u003eWhat to bring\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"lots-of-summer-clothes\"\u003eLots of summer clothes\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the heat of the summer you may find yourselves having to change a couple of times a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"lots-of-swimwear\"\u003eLots of swimwear\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the time spent in the swimming pool and in the sea, swimwear takes a battering and the sun does something to the elastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"duvet\"\u003eDuvet\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not you have central heating you will be cold in the winter, especially at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"bbq\"\u003eBBQ\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInvaluable, but can be bought on the island at reasonable prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"dishwasher\"\u003eDishwasher\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnless you constantly wash up this is a good idea as it is not advisable to leave dishes, etc, in the sink or on the side (within minutes they are covered in ants).

There are 3 strands to the in-year growth exercise:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eexceptional in-year growth for student numbers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eexceptional in-year growth for specialist post-16 institutions (SPIs)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efree meals in FE and bursary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"exceptional-in-year-growth-for-student-numbers\"\u003eExceptional in-year growth for student numbers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary way in which we account for increases in student numbers is through lagged funding. In-year growth funding is exceptional and is intended only for those with significant recruitment above their allocation, to provide a contribution to the additional in-year costs. It does not fund increases in programme size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis process does not apply to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-individualised-learner-record-ilr-returns\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eIndependent Learning Providers for whom there is a separate reconciliation process\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis process is entirely data driven; we do not accept business cases. We make growth awards on the assumption that the in-year data used is materially accurate. If later data returns (usually the R14) show that the in-year data returns are inaccurate, we will recover some or all of the in-year growth award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach year, we revisit the methodology for awarding growth and the thresholds at which individual institutions become eligible for a growth award. The key considerations of this process are the levels of growth in the sector and affordability. This year we have been able to retain the method and thresholds introduced for 2020 to 2021, which was introduced in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Compared to the method used in 2019 to 2020, institutions with very significant growth will receive the same growth award, but those with more modest growth will now receive some growth funding where previously they would not have been eligible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis does not set a precedent for the method used or thresholds in place in future years. Each year is assessed independently with thresholds and marginal rates dependent on levels of over-delivery and affordability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe calculation of growth awards this year (2021 to 2022) is a 4-step process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCalculate over-delivery (in numbers of students)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFrom the over-delivery, calculate growth\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdjust for previous under-delivery\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eApply a growth award minimum\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-1-over-delivery\"\u003eStep 1. Over-delivery\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe method we use to calculate student number over-delivery to feed into the growth calculation is dependent on the institution type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor colleges and higher education institutions submitting the individualised learner record, we calculate the student number using the reference date of 1 November.

Growth calculation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 thresholds, and we fund over-delivery at different marginal rates for the over-delivery above each threshold. The 2 thresholds are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elower threshold - 7.5% of the 2021 to 2022 allocated student number, with a minimum of 25 students and a maximum of 100 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eupper threshold - 15% of the 2021 to 2022 allocated student number with a minimum of 50 students and a maximum of 200 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not fund over-delivery below the lower threshold. We fund the over-delivery between the lower and upper thresholds at 100% of the average funding per student. We fund the over-delivery above the upper threshold at 50% of the average funding per student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe only fund the over-delivery that is above the particular threshold at the marginal rate, as shown in the example below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn institution with an allocation of 2,000 students would have a lower threshold of 100 students and an upper threshold of 200 students. If the over-delivery is 250 students, we calculate the growth as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery below the lower threshold – not funded\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery between the lower and upper thresholds – funded at 100%, i.e. 100 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery above the upper threshold – funded at 50%, i.e. 25 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth funding for this institution would be a total of 125 students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-3-previous-under-delivery\"\u003eStep 3. Previous under-delivery\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe make a deduction for any under-delivery in 2020 to 2021 before finalising the growth award. If there was under-delivery in 2020 to 2021, we deduct half of this figure from the growth award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-4-minimum-growth-award\"\u003eStep 4. Minimum growth award\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we have deducted half of the under-delivery from the previous year, if the remainder is less than 10 students, we do not make a growth award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"exceptional-in-year-growth-for-specialist-post-16-institutions-spis\"\u003eExceptional in-year growth for specialist post-16 institutions (SPIs)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"element-1-growth-for-spis\"\u003eElement 1 growth for SPIs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the calculation of programme funding increases under the national 16 to 19 funding formula (element 1 growth), the general principles outlined above are the same. However, we calculate over-delivery as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e2021 to 2022 R04 students less the 2021 to 2022 allocated students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe thresholds are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elower threshold - 7.5% of the 2021 to 2022 allocated student number, with a minimum of 5 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eupper threshold - 15% of the 2021 to 2022 allocated student number with a minimum of 10 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn SPI with an allocation of 80 students would have a lower threshold of 6 students and an upper threshold of 12 students. If the over-delivery is 20 students, we calculate the growth as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery below the lower threshold – not funded. This means we would not fund the first 6 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery between the lower and upper thresholds – funded at 100%. This means we would fund 6 students at 100%\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery above the upper threshold – funded at 50%. This means we would fund 8 students at 50%, i.e. 4 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth funding for this institution would be a total of 10 students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe deduct half of the under-delivery in 2020 to 2021 as outlined above, but there is no minimum growth award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"element-2-growth-for-spis-and-centrally-funded-exceptions\"\u003eElement 2 growth for SPIs and centrally funded exceptions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with element 1 growth, we calculate element 2 over delivery as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e2021 to 2022 R04 students less 2021 to 2022 allocated students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a single threshold:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe lower of 10% of the allocated element 2 places and 10 element 2 places.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf over-delivery exceeds the threshold, we fund all over-delivery above the threshold at the full annual rate of £6,000 per place. There are no deductions for previous under-delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also use this methodology for a small number of institutions (the ‘centrally funded exceptions’) which have their element 2 in-year growth calculated by ESFA, rather than their provider local authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn SPI has an allocation of 50 element 2 places, and records 62 in the R04 return. The threshold is 5 element 2 places (i.e. 10% of allocation). We therefore fund 7 element 2 places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"free-meals-in-further-education-fe-and-bursary-in-year-growth\"\u003eFree meals in further education (FE) and bursary in-year growth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth bursary and free meals in FE allocations are linked to the allocated student number and so an increased student number allocation resulting from the exceptional in-year growth for student numbers process may also result in increased bursary and free meals allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we are releasing additional bursary funding outside the main growth process where analysis of the data suggested that an increased student number could put an institution’s bursary allocation under considerable pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are also releasing additional free meals in FE funding to ensure that institutions have sufficient funding to support the students they recorded as eligible for, and in receipt of free meals, in their in-year data return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etransitional arrangements for bursary funding\u003c/a\u003e continue to apply. This means that an institution with a bursary allocation that was already capped at the +50% threshold above the 2019 to 2020 bursary baseline level at the start of the in-year growth process does not receive any additional bursary funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions that do qualify for additional bursary funding will only receive additional funding up to a maximum of the higher threshold (+50%).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions whose bursary allocation (prior to any in-year growth calculations) was uplifted to the lower threshold (-50%) of their 2019 to 2020 bursary baseline are potentially in scope for additional bursary funding. However, we will deduct the amount of uplift we applied to set the allocation at the lower (-50%) threshold from any additional bursary funding that we have calculated through the in-year growth process. This could mean that institutions that have met the nominal threshold for growth do not receive any additional bursary funding through this process, with their bursary allocation remaining at the lower threshold (-50%) of their 2019 to 2020 bursary baseline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"growth-calculator\"\u003eGrowth calculator\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61f92672e90e0768aabbdded/In-year_growth_calculator_2122.xlsx\"\u003ein-year growth calculator\u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003eMS Excel Spreadsheet\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e37.5 KB\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e is available which will allow you to input your institution’s figures and will calculate the potential growth award.

The Office for Place, which sits within the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), has already supported 14 local councils last year to test the application of the National Model Design Code (NMDC).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA further 25 organisations (21 local authorities and 4 neighbourhood planning groups) have received a share of £3 million this year to produce exemplar design codes and design coding processes, for other areas to follow. The Office for Place recognises that this cohort will need additional place specific expert support, guidance and review of gathered data, which cannot be provided internally by DLUHC, in order to produce exemplar design codes that can be shared widely and provide best practice and lessons for other organisations preparing design codes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Design Code Pathfinder Programme Support Grant, alongside other areas of support provided by DLUHC, will enable the 25 Design Code Pathfinders to build their capacity and produce design codes that provide certainty to local communities and developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-is-eligible\"\u003eWho is eligible\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are seeking applications from interested charitable organisations, with expertise in design coding and providing support and training to local planning authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn organisation is eligible to apply for grant funding if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIt is a third sector organisation that falls within the scope of the Charities Act 2006 definition of being a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe total grant received from government (including this grant application) is less than 50% of the organisation’s annual income in its accounting year ended in 2022, as demonstrated through its audited annual accounts. This is to ensure that the organisation does not become liable for consideration as an Arm’s Length Body.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIt is a corporate body or has a formal constitution if not incorporated.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIt has a proven track record of delivering training and support to local authorities and community groups that will improve their inhouse capacity to produce design codes.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIt has a proven track record of monitoring and evaluating outcomes from engagement.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease note this list is not exhaustive.

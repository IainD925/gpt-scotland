RSS may only be used to support accommodation cost for residential students who cannot gain their substantial qualification within daily travelling distance of their home address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"information-for-the-2015-to-2016-academic-year\"\u003eInformation for the 2015 to 2016 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the RSS delivery model has changed from a nationally managed applications model to an allocations based model. The cost of administering RSS as a nationally managed applications model was disproportionate to the number of students who receive support from the scheme.  The change to the delivery model will reduce the administrative costs, enabling the money saved to be used to support students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe nationally administered model also required institutions to verify local availability of provision with each student’s home local authority.  This process was cumbersome and resulted in inconsistent decisions being taken about which students are and are not eligible for RSS.   In the 2015 to 2016 academic year, local availability of provision will instead be verified directly with the Education Funding Agency (EFA).  This will make the process simpler for institutions and will make eligibility decisions more consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no change to RSS policy in the 2015 to 2016 academic year (please see the Residency section for further clarification of the residency criteria).  The scheme will continue to provide financial help with residential costs for eligible students living away from home because the substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification that is part of their study programme is not available locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistoric funding eligibility problems have more often arisen where students are attending institutions outside of their normal recruitment area, particularly where this involves sub-contracted provision and in such cases additional safeguards are required from institutions for all such delivery. Given the known risks of irregularity in distance sub-contracting the EFA will not normally fund such 16 to 19 provision subcontracted by institutions and would not normally expect an institution to provide residential support to students enrolled on sub-contacting provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor further information regarding sub-contracting please see the EFA funding regulation  paragraph 114 and 115 and Sub-contracting control regulations paragraphs 24,25 and 26, which set out the range of factors to be considered by institutions when deciding whether distance sub-contracting should be included in funding returns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use up to 5% of their RSS allocation to cover scheme administrative costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rss-policy-and-eligibility-in-the-2015-to-2016-academic-year\"\u003eRSS policy and eligibility in the 2015 to 2016 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRSS is intended to help support students aged 16 to 18 with the costs of living away from home to participate in a study programme where the substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification that is part of their study programme is not available locally to their home address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRSS is available to students who intend to follow a full-time study programme including either a first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 substantial qualification/s. The programme must be directly 16 to 19 funded by the EFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to receive RSS support students must meet all the eligibility criteria set out in the student eligibility section below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRSS can provide annual support of up to £3,458 (up to £4,079 in the London area) towards accommodation costs. If the student is assessed as eligible, the amount of award they receive is based on their actual accommodation costs up to the maximum award thresholds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung people on waged apprenticeship programmes, or any education or training where a wage is being drawn, are not eligible to apply for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"student-eligibility\"\u003eStudent eligibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for RSS support in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, a student must meet the following criteria:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe student must be aged at least 16 and under 19 on 31 August 2015.

For 2015 to 2016 this criterion has been aligned with the residency requirements set out in the EFA Funding  Regulations because of the change in delivery model and the wish to avoid institutions being required to assess students twice for residency (once for enrollment; once for RSS) using slightly different criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"household-income\"\u003eHousehold income\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must have a household income of £30,993 or less in the previous tax year.

The programme must be directly 16 to 19 funded by the EFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should refer to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEFA Funding Regulations\u003c/a\u003e for the 2015 to 2016 academic year for further information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe full Level 2 or full Level 3 substantial qualification should normally be the student’s first qualification at those levels. However, support for repeat qualifications may be offered in exceptional circumstances, for example, if a student:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewishes to pursue a second Level 2 which is vocational where their first Level 2 was an academic qualification\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eholds a Level 2 qualification but is required by the provider to undertake a further specific Level 2, in order to progress into the necessary Level 3 element of the programme\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis planning to enter higher education and a second level 3 qualification is specified as part of the entry requirement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the responsibility of institutions to assess where exceptions to the first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 substantial qualification criteria are appropriate.  Any such support must be a genuine exception; the EFA does not expect such support to be given from RSS funding on a routine basis.  Institutions should refer to the EFA if they have any doubts about particular cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"attending-a-study-programme-outside-of-reasonable-daily-travelling-distance\"\u003eAttending a study programme outside of reasonable daily travelling distance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe student must be living outside of reasonable daily travelling distance from the institution because the substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification that is part of their study programme is not available locally to their home address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of RSS eligibility, the key element of the study programme is the substantial qualification that is being funded by the EFA, not the study programme as a whole. If the substantial qualification is available within daily travelling distance the student is not eligible for RSS funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReasonable daily travelling distance is defined as a daily return journey that takes two hours or less on public transport; or a distance of under 15 miles from the student’s home or term-time lodgings to the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents cannot receive RSS if they are in receipt of housing benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rss-applications\"\u003eRSS applications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must apply for RSS in each academic year they require Residential Support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must have an unconditional offer of a place before they submit an application to the institution for RSS support.  Applications may be made after the student has started their study programme but awards may only be backdated to the beginning of the term in which they made the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2015 to 2016 academic year, students will apply to their institution for RSS.  As this is the first year of this delivery model, the EFA has developed an application form, based on that previously used for the nationally managed RSS model, which institutions may wish to use. The EFA will confirm to institutions separately when the form is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse of the EFA provided form is not mandatory and institutions may choose to develop their own form for RSS applications.  They must ensure that any form they develop captures all the information required to assess the student against the eligibility requirements set out in this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important for audit purposes that the student and responsible adult(s) sign and date the RSS application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should ensure that a copy of the student’s tenancy agreement has been included with the application form. This must have been agreed and signed and include the following information:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe student’s name\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe student’s term time address\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe dates of the tenancy\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe cost of the rent\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe landlord’s name, address and signature (please note: the landlord cannot be related to the student)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe student’s term time lodgings must be no further than 15 miles from campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo RSS payments should be released until all of the required information/evidence has been supplied and the application has been fully assessed, including confirmation from the EFA that the student meets the criterion for local availability of provision (see below).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure that payments are made directly to eligible students’ landlords for their rental costs.  Proof of payment should be retained for audit purposes. Payments must not be made to students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an exception, in a scenario where a student has already paid some of their rent, prior to their RSS application being approved, institutions may refund their costs (as long as the rental period they have paid for is within the agreed period of the RSS award – as outlined above. Proof of payment must be retained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"verification-of-local-availability-of-provision\"\u003eVerification of local availability of provision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVerifying local availability of provision with each student’s home local authority has been problematic and, to rectify this, from the 2015 to 2016 academic year, institutions will now verify this directly with the EFA.  This will make the process simpler for institutions as they will just need to deal with a single point of contact and will make decisions on local availability of provision more consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may choose to verify local availability of provision with the EFA before they have assessed students’ application against the other eligibility criteria or afterwards.  Institutions may prefer to send one list of all students seeking RSS funding for verification; however, requests to verify one individual may also be sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA short form will be developed for institutions to use. The form requires institutions to provide:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eeach student’s name, home postcode, Unique Learner Number and Individualised Learner Record number\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe institution’s name,  delivery location postcode and  UPIN\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe qualification reference number and qualification title that the substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification the student is following as part of their study programme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe form will confirm the email address to which it should be sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EFA will confirm to institutions separately when the form is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn receipt of the form, the EFA will assess whether the substantial Level 2 or 3 qualification each student is enrolled on is available within daily travelling distance of their home address.  Please see student eligibility criterion.  It is the availability of the substantial EFA funded qualification - not the study programme as a whole - that will determine whether the student meets the scheme criteria. Confirmation of eligibility or a rejection will be sent to the institution within 7 working days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must retain a copy of the EFA’s response as part of their auditable records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local availability of provision for each student applying for RSS support must be verified with the EFA before eligibility for RSS is confirmed and any payments are made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the EFA have verified the qualification is not available locally, RSS funding should only be released to the student to support them whilst they are studying the verified qualification. If the student transfers or fails to attend the agreed provision RSS funding should be withdrawn immediately. This action should be documented and included in the October MI return. Any unspent RSS funds may be recovered\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the EFA rejects an application because the provision can be undertaken within daily travelling distance, the institution must reject the student’s application.  No RSS payments can be made to any students who have not been confirmed as eligible by the EFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"allocations\"\u003eAllocations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRSS allocations will be paid to institutions in three instalments: 50% in August 2015, 25% in December 2015 and 25% in March 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn generating allocations we have used whichever is the highest value of each institution’s RSS awards in the 2012 to 2013, 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 academic years, ie the methodology takes account of the number of students receiving RSS support and the amount of award each one has been assessed as eligible to receive. Only institutions with RSS supported students in the 2014 to 2015 academic year have been given a funding allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the allocations methodology we matched data from RSS application forms against the data institutions entered in the individual learner record [ILR] for those students.  In some instances the data match identified students whose core aim, ie the substantial qualification they are enrolled on, on the ILR was different to that stated on the RSS application form.  Where the ILR data indicated the core aim is widely available, in other words it did not meet the RSS criterion requiring the programme to be unavailable within daily travelling distance, or that the core aim is higher than Level 3, the student has been removed from the total because they were not eligible to receive RSS funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions without an RSS allocation in the 2015 to 2016 academic year that are approached by a student for help with residential costs should follow the normal EFA business case process to request an allocation. The business case should provide the student(s) home postcode and details of their substantial Level 2 or 3 qualification to enable the EFA to check if the student is eligible (subject to the institution’s assessment of their household income etc.) as part of the consideration of the business case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should use the funding allocated to them for RSS solely to support eligible students with residential costs in line with the RSS scheme rules.  The funding cannot be used for any other purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-and-management-information-requirements\"\u003eData and management information requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EFA will ask institutions to complete a short management information return in October to report the number of students who received RSS and the amount of funding spent.  As is the case with the Residential Bursary Fund, any unspent funds will be recovered.  Data supplied in this return will be used to generate future allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the longer term, the EFA will use data from the ILR (Learner Funding and Monitoring (FAM); learner support reason) to identify students who have been assessed as eligible for RSS and who have taken up the funding to generate subsequent allocations.   Institutions are strongly encouraged to complete these fields. The EFA will review data periodically throughout the year including R14. This information will enable the development of RSS policy and help target RSS funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"audit-requirements\"\u003eAudit requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should maintain accurate and up to date records to evidence which students receive RSS funding; confirm student eligibility for funding and demonstrate appropriate use of funds.  The sections on RSS applications and verification of local availability of provision also highlight a number of points for institutions to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration and allocation of RSS is subject to the institution’s normal governance and audit regimes. RSS funding is also subject to internal checks using your data returns and external visits as part of the normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should note that, following an audit/check, funding may be recovered where RSS payments are found not to have been made in accordance with this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions who would like further information about RSS in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, should contact the EFA at \u003ca href=\"mailto:%20enquiries.EFA@education.gsi.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eenquiries.EFA@education.gsi.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

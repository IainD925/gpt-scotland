You would generally use it when developing your product (formative or iterative evaluation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFactorial \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trials\"\u003eRCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e are less useful for finding out whether your final product achieves its aims (summative evaluation) because there is less evidence for any one option.

Instead, you can run a factorial \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trial\"\u003eRCT\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou have 3 new features and you can either include or exclude each feature. This means there are 8 possible versions of the app:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe basic\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith feature A\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith feature B\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith feature C\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith features A+B\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith features A+C\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith features B+C\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewith all 3 features\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a factorial trial, you test all of these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you had 200 participants, there would be 25 participants in each group. However, if you wanted to estimate the effectiveness of feature A, you would compare 100 people who had it (in groups A, A+B, A+C, A+B+C) to 100 who did not (in groups B, C, B+C, and just with the basic app). You can do the same with the other 2 features. This achieves good \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/design-your-evaluation-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estatistical power\u003c/a\u003e to measure the effect of all 3 features without having to run 3 trials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFactorial \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trials\"\u003eRCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e rely on there being no interaction between the effects of different elements of the product. If you expect there to be an interaction effect, another design will be better. For example, the Activity tracker might be more effective at motivating people when they also had the Boxercise feature to show them what activity to do. The Boxercise feature might be more effective when people can also easily track their activity. So the effect of both features together is greater than just the sum of the effects of each feature on its own (a positive interaction or a synergistic effect).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you don’t expect there to be an interaction effect, you should test whether there is one. If there is an interaction effect and you don’t correctly assess it, your results may be wrong. You should account for the interaction effect in the analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this means that you have to treat different combinations of features as having distinct effects, so you do not get the benefit of this design. The value of the factorial design depends on there being no interaction effect. In digital health trials, there will often be an interaction. If this is the case, multi-arm designs are better. One approach is multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) trials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe factorial trial can also estimate the interaction effect (often written A×B), but it is not as precise at doing this. This is because the estimate of the effect of the interaction is only based on the 50 people who had both features A and B (groups A+B, A+B+C).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-drink-less\"\u003eExample: Drink Less\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Crane and others (2018): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22420-8\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eA smartphone app to reduce excessive alcohol consumption: Identifying the effectiveness of intervention components in a factorial randomised control trial\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis factorial design considered 5 app components for an alcohol reduction app called Drink Less. This means it had 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 32 groups. There were 672 study participants. The main outcome was number of units of alcohol consumed. Secondary outcomes included app usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe components were Self-monitoring and Feedback, Action Planning, Identity Change, Normative Feedback, and Cognitive Bias Re-training. Each component had a minimal version and an enhanced version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis only considered the main effects of each module and two-way interactions (interaction between 2 components). They found that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe combination of enhanced Normative Feedback and Cognitive Bias Re-training produced a greater reduction in alcohol consumption (the primary outcome measure) than the basic app\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe combination of enhanced Self-monitoring and Feedback and Action Planning produced greater improvements in AUDIT score (a measure of problem drinking) than the basic app\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003euse of enhanced Self-monitoring and Feedback was associated with using the app more frequently, and with people rating the app more positively on helpfulness, likelihood to recommend, and satisfaction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team were cautious in interpreting the importance of the 2-way interactions they found, because the study was not specifically designed to test them. They concluded that, while no definitive evidence was found for the effectiveness of their modules, an app with the enhanced versions of the Normative Feedback, Cognitive Bias Re-training, Self-monitoring and Feedback, and Action Planning components might produce good results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJaki T., Vasileiou D.: \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.7159\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFactorial versus multi-arm multi-stage designs for clinical trials with multiple treatments\u003c/a\u003e.

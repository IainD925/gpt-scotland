But you and your fellow trustees are jointly responsible for the decisions you make.

Trustees don’t have to see into the future, but they should follow sound principles and make informed decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf something goes seriously wrong, the Charity Commission or the courts may look into the way you made the decision. The commission doesn’t expect you to be legal or technical experts, but it will consider what you could have reasonably known or found out when you made the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rules-for-charity-meetings\"\u003eRules for charity meetings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour charity’s governing document should say how and when you should organise meetings and how to vote on decisions. You must do these things exactly as the governing document says. If you don’t, any decision you make during a meeting could be invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your governing document isn’t clear about meetings, you should think about adding to it (or agreeing extra rules).

The notice period is usually three or four weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour charity’s members can attend AGMs and other general meetings. The governing document should define who the members are. Sometimes they have to apply to join the charity, or they may qualify for membership automatically because they live in the local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, the people attending a general meeting sign a register at the door to record who is present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"trustee-meetings\"\u003eTrustee meetings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost meetings will just involve you and the other trustees, running the day-to-day business of the charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you employ staff, you might invite them to these meetings to advise or inform you but they won’t be able to vote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your charity has members, they can vote on some aspects of running the charity, such as changing the governing document and choosing trustees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"holding-meetings-online-or-by-telephone\"\u003eHolding meetings online or by telephone\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThink carefully about which form of meeting best serves the interests of your charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour charity must act within the rules of its governing document. If you wish to hold a meeting remotely, or on a hybrid basis (with some participants remote and some in person), make sure the provisions in your governing document about meetings do not prohibit this. Given changes in how people and charities work including those driven by the Covid pandemic, consider whether any provisions need amending for online, telephone or hybrid meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find more detailed information about including specific provisions in your governing document on holding online, telephone or hybrid meetings in our guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-and-meetings-cc48/charities-and-meetings#the-definition-and-forms-of-a-meeting\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003echarities and meetings\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may need to hold an in-person meeting to make these changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your charity is a charitable company, you must also ensure you meet the requirements under the Companies Act 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee further, more detailed, guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changing-your-charitys-governing-document-cc36/changing-your-charitys-governing-document-cc36\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ealterations to governing documents for unincorporated charities and charitable companies\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-make-changes-to-your-charitys-governing-document\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egoverning document guidance for CIOs\u003c/a\u003e. When making changes to your governing document check this guidance to see which documents you need to send to the Commission and, for charitable companies, to Companies House..\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that remote and hybrid meetings are conducted effectively, with accountability and integrity. The Chartered Governance Institute has produced guidance for companies on \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cgi.org.uk/assets/files/pdfs/guidance/good-practice-for-virtual-board-and-committee-meetings-web1-002(1).pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egood practice for virtual board and committee meetings\u003c/a\u003e. Charities which are not companies may also find this guidance useful as similar principles apply. The commission recommends you have at least one face-to-face meeting of all the trustees each year\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-run-a-charity-meeting\"\u003eHow to run a charity meeting\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve found a suitable date, time and venue for your meeting, following these guidelines will help you to run it effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"have-an-agenda\"\u003e1. Have an agenda\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour governing document may tell you whether you should give advance notice of items to be discussed. Generally, if all present agree, they can introduce a new item of business on the day of the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"deal-with-any-conflicts-of-interest\"\u003e2. Deal with any conflicts of interest\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a trustee’s decision-making could be influenced by their personal circumstances, or their involvement with another organisation, they are in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/manage-a-conflict-of-interest-in-your-charity\" title=\"Conflicts of interest\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econflict of interest\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegal requirement: you must prevent a conflict of interest from affecting a decision you make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"have-a-quorum--enough-people-to-make-a-decision\"\u003e3. Have a ‘quorum’ – enough people to make a decision\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA quorum is the minimum number that must attend a meeting so that decisions can be made properly. The people may be trustees at a committee meeting, or members at a general meeting. Your governing document should tell you what your quorum is. If it doesn’t, think about amending it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you set your quorum too high, any absences may make it difficult to have a valid meeting. If it’s too low, a small minority of people may be able to impose its views unreasonably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe commission recommends that the quorum for a trustees’ meeting is a minimum of one third of the total number of charity trustees plus one. So a charity with ten trustees will have a quorum of four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor general meetings, you should give careful thought to the quorum – it needs to be appropriate to the size of your charity and the number and geographical spread of members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou still need to ensure that you have a quorum throughout the course of a remote or hybrid meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"follow-voting-rules-if-applicable\"\u003e4. Follow voting rules (if applicable)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVoting arrangements differ between charities and the type of meeting that you are holding. As a general rule, you should follow the instructions in your charity’s governing document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt trustee meetings, generally only the trustees vote on decisions. If a vote is evenly split, sometimes the chair has a second, casting vote to decide the matter, but only if the governing document says so. At general meetings, the members vote on decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually a show of hands is enough to tell the result of a vote, but a poll can be used if not. You will need to ensure it is clear how those attending a virtual or hybrid meeting can vote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"keep-minutes-of-every-meeting\"\u003e5. Keep minutes of every meeting\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe commission recommends that you keep accurate minutes of all meetings. They don’t need to be word-for-word, but should give:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe name of the charity\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe type of meeting\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe date and time of the meeting\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe names of those present\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewho chaired the meeting\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat capacity people attended in, such as trustee or staff member\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany absences for agenda items due to conflicts of interest\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapologies for absence\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe minutes should record exactly what was agreed, particularly for important or controversial decisions. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe exact wording of any resolution and who proposed it\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea summary of the discussion on each item of business\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einformation used to make decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehow many votes were made for and against, and how many didn’t vote\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat action is needed and who is responsible for taking it\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe date, time and venue of the next meeting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, someone who isn’t involved in the meeting should take the minutes. If a trustee is taking the minutes, they should ensure they can also contribute actively to the discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must make the minutes of trustees’ meetings available to all charity trustees. Professional advisers such as auditors may also ask to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe minutes of a general meeting are usually made available to members (in the case of a charitable company they have to be) but you don’t have to make them available to the public unless the charity’s governing document says so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"trouble-at-meetings\"\u003eTrouble at meetings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can get very passionate about their charity’s work, and this can lead to debates and disagreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou and the other trustees are responsible for managing the charity’s meetings. Set standards of behaviour to make sure everyone present agrees to behave professionally and in the charity’s interest. For example, a \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.charitygovernancecode.org/en/front-page\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecode of conduct\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t stop people coming to a meeting if they are entitled to be there. Tell the police if you think that people intend to cause violence at a meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

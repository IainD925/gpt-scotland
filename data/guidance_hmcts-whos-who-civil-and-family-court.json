Family cases can also be heard by magistrates or single legal adviser. The judge oversees the hearing and makes sure all those involved have their case represented fairly. The judge then decides the outcome of the case. Sometimes the judge may hear the case in a room that looks less formal than a court room, called the Judge’s Chambers. In this room, parties may sit around a table during the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-court-clerkusher\"\u003eThe court clerk/usher\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe court clerk sits in front of the judge’s bench and helps the judge make sure the case runs smoothly. They keep a record of the hearing including a note of people that are attending. Not all hearings will have a court clerk present. The usher will show people where to sit in the court room and help the witnesses take the oath or affirm. To affirm means to promise the evidence being given is true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-pressmedia\"\u003eThe press/media\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe media can attend most court hearings by law.

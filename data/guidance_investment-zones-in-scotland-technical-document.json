Overview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has an ambitious plan for growth and prosperity, rooted in boosting the UK’s potential, to grow strengths in key industries to support national and local priorities across the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Scotland, the Investment Zones (IZ) programme has been designed to provide regional partners with a set of tools that can be deployed with flexibility and autonomy to boost Scotland and the United Kingdom’s innovation potential, grow strengths in key industries to drive growth, reduce economic inequalities, and level up communities across the country. This programme is committed to supporting devolution at all levels - empowering regional partners in Scotland to drive growth in partnership with UK government and Scottish Government. For more detail, please refer to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investment-zones-in-scotland-policy-model-place-selection-methodology\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eScottish Investment Zones policy and methodology note\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegional partners in Scotland are expected to ensure that proposals are designed in a way that delivers value for money and ensures accountability to their own local stakeholders. This guidance sets out the basis for this. This will require a holistic and flexible approach and must be rooted in partnership between UK and Scottish governments, local government, research institutions and the private sector, to realise the potential of our cities and regions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis document sets out further guidance to regional partners in Scotland on the approach to delivering Investment Zone proposals in Scotland only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-co-development-process\"\u003e2.

This will be a locally led process and undertaken in partnership with places and with agreement of the Scottish Government and UK government. The process will be guided by the following principles:  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eLocally led:\u003c/strong\u003e Investment Zones will be locally led, and all stages of co-development will allow flexibility and autonomy for each place to identify and select the best mix of interventions for their proposal.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePartnership:\u003c/strong\u003e co-development will be genuinely iterative and done in partnership with each place to maximise the quality, ambition, and impact of Investment Zones. Government will set the parameters and criteria, provide support and challenge to ensure plans are genuinely strategic, and identify opportunities to align with wider government policy and investment. Local knowledge on strengths, opportunities and the needs of the existing innovation base and business environment should drive each approach.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDevolved delivery:\u003c/strong\u003e building on the government’s wider devolution and funding simplification agendas, co-development, and the process for agreeing proposals will adopt a proportionate and criteria-based approach. This will allow places the flexibility to design and deliver their proposals, while providing the government with the necessary assurance that proposals are high quality and deliverable. We will set broad but clear criteria and agree specific outputs and outcomes against which to hold places to account for progress.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"gateway-stages\"\u003eGateway stages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe co-development process will be structured around a set of thematic gateways that will cover the core components of an Investment Zone proposal.

This will ensure that the overall proposal is developed to an appropriate standard, to ensure the policy delivers its stated outcomes and delivers value for money. The criteria have been designed based on several principles: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThey are based on the evidence of what constitutes successful, sustainable clusters and strong regional innovation ecosystems.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThey are stretching to ensure all Investment Zone proposals are as strong as possible and can achieve their potential.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eProposals with devolved and reserved tax incentives will be assessed separately against how well they deliver against the Investment Zone objectives and sectoral focus.

Where no match funding has been secured against an intervention, we would expect a clear rationale to be set out. We expect that each Investment Zone proposal will be matched or part-matched by private sector investment and co-funding from other public bodies where relevant. We strongly encourage REPs to go further with partners whenever possible, particularly when their interventions are focused on themes such as business support, research and innovation and local infrastructure. The programme offers each Investment Zone an overall £160 million funding envelope. If proposals include tax incentives, these are deducted from the £160 million. We would then seek at least 60% of match funding to the remaining funds. Non-domestic rates retention sits outside of the overall funding envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo catalyse the strong and positive relationship with business that Investment Zones are designed to create, REPs should ensure buy in with private sector partners, creating a shared, outcomes driven, approach. Regions should be ambitious in terms of the source of match funding, for example, avoiding the use of any expected non-domestic rates retention (NDRR) that would come out of a proposal as a source of match funding. As part of the development of Investment Zone proposals, REPs ought to make clear which proposed interventions will be match funded, at what scale and if not, why that is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scottish Government and UK government also encourage REPs to work with regional partners to ensure that conditionality is considered where possible, for example, the principle of Fair Work should be embedded at every opportunity, the consideration of a Community Wealth Building approach, and skills interventions developed with businesses in the sector to deliver an offer to young people (16–24-year-olds) through engagement with regional Jobcentre Plus Partnership teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"outcomes-and-outputs\"\u003e3.

In turn, this will help to boost regional productivity and growth, while a holistic approach will ensure that the benefits of that growth and investment are felt by local communities. These are not isolated objectives, and will support our shared and overarching Scottish and UK government ambitions, including helping to deliver on aspects of the National Strategy of Economic Transformation (particularly Productive Business and Regions) and the Scottish Government’s commitment to implement recommendation of the Regional Economic Policy Review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"introducing-the-regional-logic-model-flows-from-a-to-f\"\u003eIntroducing the regional logic model (flows from A to F)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe suggested regional logic model below sets out the framework for how Investment Zone interventions should connect and flow.

It is an articulation of what we expect Investment Zones to ultimately realise in their region if, a) constructed well in and of themselves and, b) complemented or amplified by other non-Investment Zone related activity in a region as part of a wider regional economic strategy. We will not be asking regions to provide projections for these. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as part of developing their Investment Zone proposal and logic model, regions should set out in their response to the criteria and accompanying template what interventions (activities) they will pursue with the flexible funding available, and what intervention level outputs and intermediate outcomes each of these interventions will deliver.

The ToC will steer the Investment Zones evaluation approach and provide additional questions and hypotheses to be tested. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the conclusion of the feasibility study, governments will develop and publish the M\u0026amp;E Strategy later this year, which will contain: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eshared policy aims and objectives\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea ToC summarising the evidence supporting how the Investment Zones policy is expected to progress from inputs to desired outputs, outcomes, and impacts\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epolicy questions the evaluation will be expected to answer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehigh-level overview of the methods and datasets that will be conducted as part of a robust evaluation approach (including monitoring, process evaluation, and potential impact and value for money evaluations)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprovisional timeline of deliverables the evaluation is expected to deliver, including interim and final evaluation reports\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"approach-to-evaluation-centred-design-of-policies\"\u003eApproach to evaluation-centred design of policies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe expect REPs to think about how policies could be evaluated robustly, and we will consider what resources we can use to support them to set this up and deliver it. As we continue to work with REPs to design their intervention-level policies, we will encourage REPs to identify where there are opportunities to design the implementation in such a way that allows robust evaluation such as randomised control trials (RCTs). Governments will jointly consider options to support the streamlining of the evaluation design. Governments will also consider any lessons learned from existing programmes including from the Deals and Green Freeports programme to reduce the burden from REPs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"subsidy-control\"\u003e7.

Each accountable body in England, Scotland and Wales will be able to use up to 4% of the full funding envelope (both tax and flexible spending interventions) by default to undertake necessary fund administration, such as project assessment, contracting, monitoring and evaluation and ongoing stakeholder engagement. Where an Investment Zone spends less than 4% of the funding on administration, the balance will be retained to support intervention expenditure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSetting up the fund may need a larger administration budget in the first year than in later years. This is acceptable so long as the overall percentage (4%) is not exceeded over the full funding period. Any expenditure incurred prior to the release of funding is at the accountable body’s own risk, and how it is met is subject to local arrangements following the release of funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"annex-a-criteria-for-investment-zones-proposals\"\u003eAnnex A: Criteria for Investment Zones proposals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"approach\"\u003eApproach\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis document sets out the criteria that an Investment Zone proposal would be expected to display at each gateway before agreement being reached across all parties that the proposal can progress to the next stage.

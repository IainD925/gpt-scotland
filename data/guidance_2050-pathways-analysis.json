For this to happen, we need to transform the UK economy while ensuring secure, low-carbon energy supplies to 2050. \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe 2050 Calculator\u003c/a\u003e is an award-winning, user-friendly model that lets you create your own UK emissions reduction pathway, and see the impact using real scientific data. The Calculator helps everyone engage in the debate and lets Government make sure our planning is consistent with this long-term aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are currently updating our pathways information. As part of this update there will be a new UK Pathways Calculator. The new calculator will use the latest available data and explore pathways beyond 2050, as well as those that meet the 2050 target. The My2050 simulation will also be updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe original Calculator was released by \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Energy and Climate Change\"\u003eDECC\u003c/abbr\u003e (now BEIS) and is currently available in three versions to allow a range of audiences to explore the fundamental question of how the UK can best meet energy needs while reducing emissions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe new look \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eweb-tool version\u003c/a\u003e of the Calculator for a detailed look at the issue with a user friendly interface\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://classic.2050.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e“classic”\u003c/a\u003e version of the webtool that allows you to see all your options in one view\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2050-pathways-calculator-with-costs\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efull Excel version\u003c/a\u003e of the Calculator for experts who want to look at the underpinning model.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the UK Pathways Calculator is being updated, the simplified My2050 simulation and the My2050 Schools Toolkit have been taken offline.

It is system-wide, covering all parts of the economy and all greenhouse gas emissions released in the UK. It is rooted in scientific and engineering realities, looking at what is thought to be physically and technically possible in each sector. It allows you, as the user of the Calculator, to explore all the available options and some of their key implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe it is essential to be transparent about the assumptions and approach used in the 2050 work, which is why we have published the full Calculator model.

For example, you can choose to build up to 40,000 offshore wind turbines or up to 50 3GW nuclear power stations, you can allocate up to 20% of the UK’s land to growing bio crops and you can reduce our use of landfill sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor each choice four trajectories have been developed, ranging from little or no effort to reduce emissions (level 1) to extremely ambitious changes that push towards the physical or technical limits of what can be achieved (level 4). The assumptions behind these trajectories are explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can explore some of the wider implications of your pathway by using the web-tool’s tabs. For example, you can see the implications of your pathway for the size of the electricity sector, you can visually track how energy flows through the system, and you can see how much your new energy system will cost to build.

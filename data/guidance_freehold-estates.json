The government is committed to improving rights of homeowners living on these estates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-are-freehold-estates\"\u003eWhat are freehold estates?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreehold estates are private and mixed tenure estates where, unlike other residential areas, shared areas and facilities are not owned or looked after by the local council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOwnership and management will rest with someone else. This might be a private provider or homeowners themselves as part of an ‘estate management company’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, the management company will employ a managing agent to carry out or oversee maintenance, upkeep, or repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-people-living-on-these-estates\"\u003eWhat does it mean for people living on these estates?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHomeowners living on freehold estates pay towards the management and maintenance of communal areas or services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHomeowners are required to pay a management company, who will be responsible for carrying out such work, or employing a manging agent to do so on their behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost homeowners pay will depend on a number of factors. This includes what types of facilities or services they need to maintain, and the number of properties required to contribute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no discount from Council Tax to take account of estate rent charges. The amount of Council Tax each household pays is not adjusted to reflect the specific services they receive. It is collected to deliver a broad range of services across the wider local community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny homeowner who is unhappy with the way in which their shared areas or facilities are managed, or considers they are paying too much, should seek their own legal advice on how to proceed. They may need to apply to the county court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-will-homeowners-know-if-they-have-to-pay-estate-rent-charges\"\u003eHow will homeowners know if they have to pay estate rent charges?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe requirement to pay will be set out in legal documents that are signed when the property is bought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the home buying process, it is advisable for prospective buyers and their legal representative to check this information to make sure they understand the ongoing costs involved in owning their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHome buyers should seek their own legal advice if they believe that they did not receive relevant or important information about their new home at the time of sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

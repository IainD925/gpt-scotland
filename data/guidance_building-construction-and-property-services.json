Use of standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. You can use the Integrated Tariff of the UK to classify your goods. For more information, see the guide on the classification of goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that in general it is much simpler to trade with other \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e countries than with countries outside the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e. This is because the goods are in free circulation. The \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e is a single market and the UK is in a customs union, so you can trade with other \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e countries without restriction (although some local charges may still apply).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e runs the Authorised Economic Operator (\u003cabbr title=\"Authorised Economic Operator\"\u003eAEO\u003c/abbr\u003e) scheme for businesses.

You may require an export licence for goods with a potential military use - such as steel tubes or some building plans. You may also need a licence to export services, such as fulfilling a contract to build a military installation abroad.

If the building is outside the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e, you can zero-rate the work, which means that you don’t have to charge VAT. However, if the value of the work goes over the current VAT threshold in the country in which you’re working, you may have to register for and charge VAT or general sales tax in that country as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"leasing-equipment-to-and-from-third-countries\"\u003eLeasing equipment to and from third countries\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, you must charge VAT on leased goods and pay VAT on goods that you hire in a third country.

Simply exporting and re-importing these items can be complicated and involve the risk of paying duty, both overseas and when bringing the goods back to the UK. Special procedures can be efficient ways to avoid being taxed twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial rules apply to using leased equipment overseas, and may reduce the capital allowances you can claim. Read about \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/camanual/ca24010.htm\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eoverseas leasing on the \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e website.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"temporary-exports-and-tools-of-trade\"\u003eTemporary exports and tools of trade\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraders can use an ATA carnet or a temporary import declaration for some types of temporary imports and exports, including tools and some equipment. But remember that the ATA carnet is not an export licence for controlled goods. For more information, see the guide to ATA and CPD carnets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duplicate List procedure also helps workers who take tools abroad to cut red tape. Workers need two copies of a list of the goods and their description, quantity, and value on business stationery. The list must declare the type of goods, eg tools, the reason why you’re taking them abroad and, if known, your return date. Workers must also complete customs form C\u0026amp;E 1246 and take the form and both copies of the list on their journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen leaving the UK, the goods must travel with you. You must also show customs officers the paperwork. Officers will endorse it and give you back the C\u0026amp;E 1246 and one copy of the list to be kept with the goods. When you come back to the UK, present the C\u0026amp;E 1246 and the list with the goods to the Red Point (or in the Red Channel) on passing through customs. If you have left any goods in the country you have visited, you must declare this to the customs officer, who will let you know about further proper procedures. Read about the Duplicate List procedure scheme in the guide on temporary exportation from the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCustoms procedures for sending equipment to third (non \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e) countries in separate containers follow the same principles as those for single consignments. Even if the equipment travels by separate means of transport, the consignment is still treated as one entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the goods arrive in the destination third country, you, your freight forwarder or your customer will have to make an import declaration. In some countries, duty payment may be suspended for temporary imports. You should check with your customer or the consulate of the destination country for specific arrangements, which vary from state to state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"returned-goods\"\u003eReturned goods\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraders may also be able to claim returned goods relief on exported tools and equipment returned to the country within three years.

Often your products will be re-imported in more than one consignment, or to different locations. So that \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e can track the goods, importers are normally required to produce a copy of the export declaration and/or a copy of the departure message. When the products are re-imported, \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e check that the correct amount of duty is declared and that the re-imported goods are deducted or ‘exhausted’ from the quantity exported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen compensating products are re-imported in more than one consignment, a balance of exported goods will remain on the export declaration after the first consignment is cleared. \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e keep the declaration to check that ineligible goods are not being imported.

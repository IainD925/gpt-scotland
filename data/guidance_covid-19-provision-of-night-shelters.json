Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities and voluntary, faith, and community groups have gone to extraordinary lengths since March 2020 to protect vulnerable people who sleep rough from the risks of COVID-19. This has seen communal shelters either being closed or transformed into self-contained accommodation to reduce the spread COVID-19. These adapted models often provide safer environments, offer greater protection to individuals with underlying health conditions, and can produce better move-on outcomes for individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, we know that local circumstances may mean that there are limited occasions where a service provider decides to put in place communal models to prevent people sleeping rough, particularly in extreme weather. These settings should not be opened without written agreement from your local authority and the local Director of Public Health, based on a comprehensive risk assessment\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance has been drafted with advice and input from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This guidance sets out advice on how night shelters can operate more safely, based on public health principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been updated to reflect the publication of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLiving with COVID-19 strategy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet, including night shelters. For more information please see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-safely-with-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on face coverings\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing this guidance will help people attending or working in shelters to take steps to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in the community, stay safe and save lives while the risk of infection remains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance applies in England alongside the relevant associated changes to the law.

You or the venue manager can do this by uncovering vents, and opening doors and windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLetting fresh air into indoor spaces is important because when a person infected with COVID-19 coughs, talks or breathes, they release droplets and aerosols which can be breathed in by another person. The more fresh air there is to breathe, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"limit-close-contact\"\u003eLimit close contact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough social distancing is no longer required, staff, volunteers, and guests may choose to limit the close contact they have with people they do not usually live with, particularly if they are not fully vaccinated. This is a personal choice which can help reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShelter providers should be prepared to support those who wish to maintain social distancing, especially around those who may be more vulnerable.

Anybody entering a shelter, whether as a member of staff, a volunteer, or a service user, should consider getting vaccinated, if they haven’t already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice in March 2021, homeless people and those experiencing rough sleeping are considered a priority group, alongside cohort 6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders should also consider how to increase uptake among their guests, including encouraging guests who have only had their first or second dose, to have their second or a booster dose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuests should be reminded that they do not need an NHS number or a GP registration to receive a vaccine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities in England have recently received funding through the Protect and Vaccinate fund to encourage uptake of vaccination amongst people sleeping rough. We strongly encourage providers to work in partnership with their local authority to enable uptake of vaccination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"get-tested\"\u003eGet tested\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you develop COVID-19 symptoms, please follow the guidance set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for people with respiratory symptoms\u003c/a\u003e even if your symptoms are mild and you are fully vaccinated. Staff and volunteers should self-isolate at home while they book the test and wait for the results. You must self-isolate if you test positive. Your isolation period includes the day your symptoms started (or the day your test was taken if you do not have symptoms). It is now possible to end self-isolation after 7 days, following two negative LFD tests taken 24 hours apart. The first LFD test should not be taken before the fifth day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders should support staff, volunteers and guests to access regular asymptomatic lateral flow (LFD) testing, and confirmatory PCR testing where appropriate. Rapid lateral flow testing is available for free to anybody, and is particularly recommended if you will be in a high-risk situation that day. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFind out more about how to get LFD tests\u003c/a\u003e. Providers should also develop plans to support people with COVID-19 symptoms, or a positive test, to isolate and to trace their recent contacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHS COVID-19 app is a vital part of NHS Test and Trace in England and Wales. Using the app helps stop the spread of the virus by informing you that you have been in close contact with someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus, even if you don’t know each other. Those who are able to use the app should be encouraged to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"further-guidance\"\u003eFurther guidance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recommend that providers of night shelters follow \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for people with respiratory symptoms and their contacts\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFully vaccinated means that you have been vaccinated with an MHRA approved COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, and at least 14 days have passed since you received the recommended doses of that vaccine.

For clear safety reasons individual rooms and individual washing facilities should be the aim to appropriately protect individuals from communicable diseases such as COVID-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll forms of night shelter present a level of risk to people with clinical vulnerabilities. However, it is even more challenging to implement robust infection control and outbreak management in rotating night shelter models.

Cohorting is a strategy which can contribute to limiting the spread of disease by supporting people to access different areas/sites depending on their status. For example, contacts can be in a separate area of the shelter and non-contacts in another.

In this event, commissioners and/or providers should seek advice from their local Health Protection Team. This remains the case whether the provider has a contract with the local authority or not. Local authorities should have a clear picture of all alternative local provision that could be used in the case of an outbreak. An outbreak control team may be brought together to consider appropriate mitigation which may include measures to introduce social distancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile social distancing will no longer apply, it may be appropriate to retain it depending on the risks. Equally, it may be appropriate to reapply it after it has been lifted if assessments suggest doing so. Assessments will be carried out by service managers in consultation with or as a result of advice from Directors of Public Health or in the context of an outbreak control team led by the local Health Protection Team, who will be able to continue to advise on social distancing measures to control and prevent outbreaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of social distancing should be targeted, time limited, and kept under review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"vaccination\"\u003e5.\tVaccination\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCOVID-19 vaccines are available to everyone free of charge\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who experience homelessness and rough sleeping are likely to have underlying health conditions, which can make them vulnerable to COVID-19. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has therefore prioritised them for being offered COVID-19 vaccines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey also may experience additional barriers to accessing vaccination. Providers have a role in informing people about the vaccine and should actively support guests to take up the vaccine where appropriate. This includes encouraging guests who have only received their first dose to access their second, and future access to any potential COVID-19 vaccine booster programme. There are leaflets and posters about the vaccination programme available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders should support local health teams in their vaccination plans, including helping them identify individuals in this group and appropriate sites to deliver vaccinations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no requirement for people to have an NHS number or to be registered with a GP to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from local teams. The COVID-19 vaccine is also available irrespective of immigration status and no data will be shared with immigration authorities when a vaccination offer is accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it may be operationally challenging to provide the second dose without GP registration or the ability to call back individuals. Providers should make every effort to support people to become fully vaccinated.

Social distancing and capacity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSocial distancing rules no longer apply in law. This means that you do not need to implement social distancing (2m or 1m+) in night shelters, and guests do not need to keep apart from people they don’t live with.\nHowever, the further away guests can keep from other people, and the less time they spend in close contact with others, the less likely they are to catch COVID-19 and pass it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClose contact increases the risk of spreading COVID-19.

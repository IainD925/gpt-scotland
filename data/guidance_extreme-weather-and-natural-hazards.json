They may affect you if you are travelling or living overseas. You may hear the term ‘natural disasters’ to describe these events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis page has guidance for if you are travelling or living in an area which is prone to extreme weather or may have natural hazards. It includes how to be prepared and what to do if you’re likely to be affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many extreme weather events and other natural hazards that might happen around the world.

The effects can be more extreme and serious if this infrastructure has not been designed properly to withstand these events, or to protect you while they are taking place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the event has happened, you should be aware of possible risks relating to damaged buildings or other infrastructure. Be aware that events in places away from where you are can still cause disruption, such as through loss of power, communications or transport services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may take time for airports to re-open and there may be serious shortages of accommodation, food, water and health facilities. It may be harder for you to receive help from humanitarian workers if it is difficult to access the area due to transport infrastructure damage or flooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Foreign, Commonwealth \u0026amp; Development Office’s (FCDO) ability to help British nationals may be limited (perhaps severely) in these circumstances.

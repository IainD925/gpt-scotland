Government-funded testing will continue to focus on these groups. In March 2023, the Government announced further changes towards managing COVID-19 like other respiratory illnesses. New changes from 1 April 2024 are the next stage in delivering this approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ongoing success of the vaccination programme, increased access to treatments and high immunity among the population have allowed the government to scale back testing in England. From April onwards, testing will be provided to individuals at highest risk from COVID-19, continuing to support diagnosis for care and access to treatments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 1 April 2024, routine provision of free COVID-19 lateral flow device (\u003cabbr title=\"lateral flow device\"\u003eLFD\u003c/abbr\u003e) tests for the management of outbreaks in higher risk settings will come to an end in England. However, free polymerase chain reaction (\u003cabbr title=\"polymerase chain reaction\"\u003ePCR\u003c/abbr\u003e) testing to determine the cause of an acute respiratory infection outbreak in higher risk settings, where deemed appropriate by a local UK Health Security Agency (\u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e) health protection team (\u003cabbr title=\"health protection team\"\u003eHPT\u003c/abbr\u003e), will remain to test for a wide range of respiratory viruses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe cohort of people eligible for COVID-19 treatments can still access free COVID-19 \u003cabbr title=\"lateral flow devices\"\u003eLFDs\u003c/abbr\u003e from their local pharmacy. These people, who are at highest risk of getting seriously ill, are encouraged to test to gain timely access to treatments.

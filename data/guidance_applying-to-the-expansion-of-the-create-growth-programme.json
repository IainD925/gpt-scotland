The purpose is to expand the programme to cover six new geographical areas. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is inviting local area partnerships in England (except London) to submit Expressions of Interest (EOIs) to participate in the expanded CGP from FY23/24 to FY24/25 (two years).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CGP is an expansion of the Creative Scale Up pilot (2019-2021), which provided the Greater Manchester, West Midlands and West of England Combined Authorities with a package of business and investor support to support creative businesses to scale and access finance outside London. The CGP was launched in FY2022/23 in 6 regions in England outside London, providing creative businesses in those regions with a bespoke package to support high-growth potential creative businesses and build investor networks. The CGP comprises three complementary strands: business support targeted at the creative industries; finance; and investor capacity building activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal area partnerships will be directly responsible for delivering targeted business support to high-growth potential creative businesses. It is expected that participation in the CGP will help to build local knowledge, capacity and infrastructure to support creative businesses beyond the programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEOI applicants will be shortlisted by a panel appointed by DCMS. Shortlisted applicants will be invited to submit full applications to bid to participate in the programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003ch2 id=\"competition-timeline-and-events\"\u003eCompetition timeline and events\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n  \u003ctable\u003e\n    \u003cthead\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eEvent\u003c/th\u003e\n        \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eDate/Deadline\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003c/thead\u003e\n    \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eEOI Stage opens\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eFriday 14 July 2023\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eDeadline for submission of EOIs\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eWednesday 9 August 2023, 23:59 BST\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eShortlisted applicants invited to submit full applications\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eWednesday 23 August 2023\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eDeadline for shortlisted applicants to submit full applications\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eTuesday 19 September 2023, 23:59 BST\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eFinal decision on successful applicants\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003ctd\u003eOctober 2023\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003c/tbody\u003e\n  \u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-can-apply\"\u003eWho can apply\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe programme is open to EOIs from local area partnerships in England and outside of London only. London boroughs and the Greater London Authority are excluded from applying to the programme either as a standalone application or as part of a consortium bid.

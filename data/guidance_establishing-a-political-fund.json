A trade union which has its head or main office in Great Britain and has members in Northern Ireland should seek guidance from the Certification Office at an early stage and may also need to contact the Northern Ireland Certification Officer, 10-16 Gordon Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland B1 2LG (Tel: 028 9023 7773  Fax: 028 9023 22771 email: info@nicertoffice.org.uk).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003e1.

It is for the local planning authority and the applicant to discuss and agree a suitable process, format and content which is proportionate to the scale of the project and the complexity of the issues to be addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with all project management approaches, it is always sensible to keep the content of planning performance agreements as straightforward as possible and the guiding principle should be that the parties agree the way forward. As a minimum, a simple approach, such as one built around an agreed timetable, development objectives and responsibility for tasks could be sufficient. In very complex schemes of strategic importance there may be a need to develop a shared vision to encourage greater collaborative working. There will always need to be a clear and agreed timescale for reaching a decision on the application once it is submitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA planning performance agreement can extend to matters beyond the formal application process – such as programming the negotiation of any section 106 agreement and related non-planning consents.  For very large or complex schemes the agreement may also provide a basis for any voluntary contributions which the applicant has offered to pay to assist with abnormal costs of processing the application. The parties will want to ensure that such payments do not exceed the cost of the additional work involved, are not seen to have any implications for the decision on the application, and do not deflect resources from processing other cases; any additional resource provided in this way needs to be used for additional capacity that is genuinely required to ensure a timely and effective service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 018 Reference ID: 20-018-20150326\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 26 03 2015 \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141202102440/http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/before-submitting-an-application/planning-performance-agreements/#paragraph_018\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSee previous version\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-much-should-a-planning-performance-agreement-cost\"\u003eHow much should a planning performance agreement cost?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal planning authorities may make a charge for the administrative work involved in agreeing and implementing the planning performance agreement itself, to the extent that this goes beyond an authority’s statutory responsibilities.

Likewise, if an applicant does not abide by the agreement, the local planning authority may not be able to follow the agreed process.

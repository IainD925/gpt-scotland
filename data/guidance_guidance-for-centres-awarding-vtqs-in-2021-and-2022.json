We have added sections on \u003ca href=\"#reasonable-adjustments\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ereasonable adjustments\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"#special-consideration\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003especial consideration\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-document\"\u003eAbout this document\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis document is for those working in colleges, schools, training providers and other settings (or ‘centres’) where assessments for vocational and technical qualifications (\u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e) and general qualifications other than GCSEs, AS and A levels, Advanced Extension Awards (AEAs) and project qualifications (or ‘other general qualifications’) are scheduled to take place in the academic year 2021 to 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this guidance we explain how \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e and other general qualifications will be awarded this academic year. We outline what we expect from awarding organisations and what you and your students should expect to happen over the coming year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor information about the arrangements for GCSEs, AS and A levels, see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-gcses-as-and-a-levels-guide-for-schools-and-colleges-2022\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuide for schools and colleges 2022: GCSEs, AS and A levels\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"arrangements-for-awarding-vtqs-in-the-academic-year-2021-to-2022\"\u003eArrangements for awarding \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e in the academic year 2021 to 2022\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government’s intention is that exams and other formal assessments, including for \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e and other general qualifications, will go ahead in the academic year 2021 to 2022. We have looked at how our regulations can help make this happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe know students taking exams and assessments this year may be experiencing or have already experienced disruption to their learning or work over the last year as a result of the pandemic. We understand that students may be anxious about completing exams or formal assessments and may need further support from you this year. We also know that this disruption has resulted in considerable additional pressure for teachers, exams officers and other staff in colleges, schools and training providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur regulations can help awarding organisations support you so you can help your students to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding in assessments. And your students can achieve their outcomes and progress to the next stage of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"qualifications-can-be-adapted\"\u003eQualifications can be adapted\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on students and their learning, we are continuing to allow awarding organisations to adapt their exams and other formal assessments for \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe require awarding organisations to continue to carefully balance mitigating the effects of the pandemic on teaching and learning with the need to ensure that results are fair, consistent and allow students to progress. For example, assessments may need to be adapted to free up time to focus on catch-up and teaching the remaining qualification content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have put in place a number of requirements that awarding organisations must follow when determining if their adaptations remain appropriate in the context of the 2021 to 2022 academic year. For example, we still expect that all content should be taught, as far as is feasible, so that students are as well-prepared as possible for progression to the next stage of their education, training, or employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo align with Government policy, this year, we are no longer allowing awarding organisations to award results using alternative evidence such as teacher assessed grades (\u003cabbr title=\"Teacher-assessed grades\"\u003eTAGs\u003c/abbr\u003e). These were a necessary mitigation when exams and formal assessments could not take place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also expect awarding organisations to consider how making some adaptations could make their \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e more resilient if there is further disruption so that exams and other formal assessments could continue, as far as possible. We require awarding organisations to ensure, as far as possible, that the adaptations applied do not disadvantage, or advantage, students against their peers taking similar \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e or, where relevant, GCSEs, AS and A levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are continuing to work closely with awarding organisations, as we have done throughout the pandemic, so that awarding organisations provide colleges, training providers and schools with clear information in a timely manner to enable assessments to run smoothly. In turn, we expect awarding organisations to continue to work collaboratively together and with centres, professional organisations and sector bodies in ensuring their approaches to awarding make sure that students completing these qualifications this year have the knowledge and skills employers expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a range of different qualification structures and assessment methods used in \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e. As last year, we are expecting awarding organisations offering similar qualifications to continue to work with each other to ensure consistency is maintained where possible and appropriate. Awarding organisations will have different approaches, because of the variety of assessment methods, structures, and purposes of \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e. Awarding organisations are best placed to understand the kinds of adaptation that work best for their qualifications and meet the needs of the students that take them so where there are differences, this is for a good reason. These adaptations could include the provision of advance information where this is appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Conditions, requirements and guidance setting out our regulatory requirements for awarding organisations offering \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e and other general qualifications affected by the coronavirus pandemic this year are set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vocational-and-technical-qualifications-contingency-regulatory-framework\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eVocational and Technical Qualifications Contingency Regulatory Framework (the \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and Technical Qualifications Contingency Regulatory Framework\"\u003eVCRF\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs in any other year it is important to us that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eresults secure public confidence so teachers and employers can be confident this year’s results will reflect what students know, understand, and can do, and students can progress to the next stage of their lives\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003estudents receiving \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational or technical qualification\"\u003eVTQ\u003c/abbr\u003e and other general qualification results this year are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged compared to students studying for GCSEs, AS and A levels.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reasonable-adjustments\"\u003eReasonable adjustments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReasonable adjustments are changes made to an assessment or the delivery of an assessment before it takes place. Awarding organisations are required under the Equality Act 2010 to make reasonable adjustments to their assessments for disabled students to reduce or remove a disadvantage caused by a student’s disability.  Adjustments should be based on evidence that they are needed by the student, should reflect their normal way of working within the centre and be reasonable in terms of cost and time to implement. An adjustment cannot be permitted if it could affect the validity of the assessment or mean that some students could be unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you believe that some of your students require a reasonable adjustment you should check with your awarding organisation. Some adjustments can be put in place by centres and others need approval by the awarding organisation. Some adjustments may be unique to an individual student and may not be mentioned within the awarding organisation’s policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should ensure that you apply for any adjustments needed well in advance of the planned assessment date. This will ensure that there is plenty of time to make arrangements before the assessment takes place. Awarding organisations will be able to provide you with information about when to apply for adjustments for the qualifications they make available. Centres should contact the relevant awarding organisation as soon as possible if they become aware an adjustment is required that hasn’t been applied for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"special-consideration\"\u003eSpecial consideration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs in pre-pandemic years, special consideration is any adjustment given to a student who has temporarily experienced an illness, injury or other event outside of their control at the time of the assessment which significantly affects their ability to take an assessment or demonstrate what they can do in an assessment. Special consideration is only for things that happen immediately before or during an assessment that has a material effect on a student’s ability to take that assessment or on how they performed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease be aware that students will not be granted special consideration because their education has been disrupted either by the pandemic or for any other reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you believe a student is eligible for special consideration, then you should follow your awarding organisation’s process. The application should be made as soon as possible. Your awarding organisation will be able to confirm the deadlines for applying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, due to the type of assessment or the nature of the situation, it might be possible for the student to take their assessment at a later date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a student feels unwell on the day of their assessment you should follow \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057106/220224_Schools_guidance.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance from the Department for Education\u003c/a\u003e, along with your own procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-this-means-for-you\"\u003eWhat this means for you\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYour awarding organisation should have provided you with the information you need to support you in implementing their adaptations. They should also provide you with details of the arrangements that will need to be made for any students who need reasonable adjustments.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThis year, awarding organisations are likely to ask you for more information about which students are planning to take assessments, when they plan to take them and when they are likely to be ready for certification. You might find it helpful to start capturing this information as early as possible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"arrangements-for-continuing-students\"\u003eArrangements for continuing students\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents who completed some of their exams or formal assessments in either the 2019 to 2020 or the 2020 to 2021 academic years, and who will complete the remainder of their qualification this academic year or in the future, are able to carry forward any results they have achieved so far. This applies whether the result was awarded using an adapted assessment or through use of alternative sources of evidence, such as \u003cabbr title=\"Teacher-assessed grades\"\u003eTAGs\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same way, students starting new programmes of study this year will be able to carry the results of their adapted assessments forward.  You can find updates for the arrangements for the 2022 to 2023 academic year \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofqual\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eon our website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-this-means-for-you-1\"\u003eWhat this means for you\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make sure these arrangements are as manageable as possible for centres, many awarding organisations may use their normal quality assurance policies and procedures, however arrangements may be adapted to reflect current public health advice, for example on-site visits may be adapted to remote or virtual visits. Your awarding organisation will tell you what to expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"performance-table-qualifications\"\u003ePerformance table qualifications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAwarding organisations must take account of the Department for Education’s technical guidance when developing their approach to adaptation for \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e approved for inclusion in performance tables. Where it is possible to do so, we expect awarding organisations to use similar approaches to adaptation for other qualifications at the same level leading to similar progression opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAssessments can be reduced, as is also possible for \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e that are not included in performance tables, but we expect that all of the qualification content should be taught where this is possible and the number of guided learning hours for each qualification should remain the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is worth noting that the Department for Education has \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/866418/Decisions_-_Performance_Table_Qualifications_-_FINAL2065891.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edecided not to limit the number of resits\u003c/a\u003e that are permitted for qualifications listed in performance tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"t-levels\"\u003eT Levels\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrangements for the Technical Qualifications of T Levels are in line with other \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e. This means that there may be adaptations put in place for the core component assessments where this is appropriate and occupational specialism components exams and assessments should go ahead in 2021 to 2022. In the case of further significant disruption, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/awarding-qualifications-in-summer-2022\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethe Department for Education may permit further adaptations to content and/or delivery of assessments where appropriate\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"functional-skills-qualifications\"\u003eFunctional Skills qualifications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with other \u003cabbr title=\"Vocational and technical qualifications\"\u003eVTQs\u003c/abbr\u003e, we expect all Functional Skills qualifications (\u003cabbr title=\"Functional skills qualifications\"\u003eFSQs\u003c/abbr\u003e) assessments to go ahead in 2021 to 2022 and the full subject content to be taught across all levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur expectation is that awarding organisations will continue to put in place adaptations relating to the delivery of FSQ assessments where necessary.

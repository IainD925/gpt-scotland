These impurities could include, for example, sand and other aggregates or even straw. Common pottery articles usually have a natural colour such as yellow, red, grey or beige — they’re rarely white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to scratch or score common pottery articles because they’re quite soft compared with other types of ceramic. Bowl-shaped articles give a dull sound when they’re tapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommon pottery is typically used to make things such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egarden pots\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edrainage pipes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebricks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarthenware items are usually glazed. Earthenware is porous and has impurities, but they’re small and invisible to the naked eye. Unglazed areas are easy to scratch —  they give off a powder (‘dandruff’) when they’re scored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarthenware articles usually have a natural colour like grey, red, brown, yellow, cream or off-white. Sometimes the clay is dyed before it’s shaped.

It is a common mistake to think that any red or red-brown pottery must be terracotta, but it may not be. Most clays, including stoneware and porcelain, can be dyed or pigmented to give a terracotta colour, but they will not have the other characteristics of true terracotta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrue terracotta — including branded Terracotta — can usually be identified as earthenware as it has the same characteristics. You may need a laboratory test to be absolutely sure. You can usually identify it correctly by looking closely at it, scratching it and tapping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"stoneware\"\u003eStoneware\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStoneware is not porous (except under laboratory testing). Often it is not glazed, although articles like kitchenware and tableware usually do have a glaze. It is difficult to scratch and common colours include off-white, grey or blue-grey, and beige. Sometimes the clay’s dyed before it’s shaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBowl-shaped stoneware articles give a clear sound when they’re tapped.

It is often calcined — fired and mixed with materials such as steatite to make things like firebricks for kilns. Sometimes it’s mixed with clay and fired to make household articles. These are similar to earthenware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDolomite and other stone can also be crushed and mixed with resins before being made into articles like house-wares and ornaments. Household items made of dolomite are almost always mixed with a material like clay or resin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"porcelain-or-china\"\u003ePorcelain or china\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePorcelain or china includes bone china. It is non-porous and usually difficult to scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePorcelain articles are usually white and shiny. Sometimes the clay is dyed before it’s shaped. Porcelain is normally translucent when it’s held up to a light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTypical trade names for porcelain articles include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eBone China\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eJet Enamelled Ware\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eParian Ware\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePythagoras Ware\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRockingham Ware\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"porcelain-look-alikes\"\u003ePorcelain look-alikes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, pottery is made up to look like porcelain. ‘imitation porcelain’ and ‘semi-porcelain’ items are glazed and decorated to resemble porcelain, but they’re quite different in other ways. For example, beneath their shiny white glaze they’re rough grained, dull and porous, and can easily be scratched with a steel knife (although some soft china can also be scratched like this). Articles like this are not classified as porcelain or china.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"glazing-preparations\"\u003eGlazing preparations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFired ceramics can be glazed or unglazed.

However, institutions have the discretion, in line with this guide, to decide which students get \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e support and how much support they should get. Institutions should manage the number and size of \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e awards they make to keep within their budget, targeting available funds towards those facing the most significant financial barriers to participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should assess each student’s actual need for help with residential costs, ie by assessing their household income, before deciding whether to award \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e support. \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e should not be awarded simply because a student is enrolled in residentially delivered provision. It is good practice for institutions to publish their \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e policy to help students understand the criteria against which they will be assessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e payments for accommodation must be made directly to the student’s landlord.  The landlord may be the institution itself if they provide accommodation directly or a private landlord. No payments should be made directly to the student - any such payment would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income related Benefits Regulations 2000). Receipt of other benefits and/or financial support does not exclude a student from receiving help with residential costs if they are experiencing financial difficulties in meeting the costs associated with participating in education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may wish to consider keeping a contingency fund to respond to needs which come up later in the academic year in response to changes in a student’s circumstances rather than allocating all funds at the start of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e to support residential students travel costs from their term time lodgings to site (up to the maximum of 15% of their allocation, capped at £25,000; in other words, where 15% of the institution’s allocation is greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum amount that may be spent). The use of \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e for travel costs does not replace the statutory duty on local authorities to set out, in an annually published transport statement, the arrangements they will make to facilitate the participation in education or training of young people of sixth-form age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e should not be used by an institution for any purpose designed to give them a competitive advantage over other institutions; nor should \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e be used for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eenrolment or administration fees\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efees for access to college facilities\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eblock subsidy of transport\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecosts that are in the scope of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echildcare costs that are in the scope of the Care to Learn scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn determining arrangements for payment of \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Bursary Fund\"\u003eRBF\u003c/abbr\u003e, institutions are subject to equalities legislation, which means they must not discriminate against their students on the basis of their protected characteristics.

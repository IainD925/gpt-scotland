We calculate additional students by comparing the number of students enrolled on eligible maths qualifications in the current year with a historic baseline of eligible enrolments. We calculate the advanced maths premium element in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-how-it-works#funding-formula-and-study-programmes\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e16 to 19 funding formula\u003c/a\u003e after area costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe baseline is an average of the advanced maths enrolments recorded between academic year 2019 to 2020 and academic year 2020 to 2021. From academic year 2024 to 2025, the baseline will no longer include \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/core-maths-qualifications-technical-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecore maths qualifications\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn April 2023, we explained that when we updated the data we used to calculate the baseline for academic year 2023 to 2024 allocations, some advanced maths premium allocations changed significantly. We calculated the difference between the 2022 to 2023 allocation and the 2023 to 2024 allocation. We then provided 100% of the funding difference between the 2 for those institutions that lost £20,000 or more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor academic year 2024 to 2025 only, we will continue this financial protection with some changes.

For those qualifications that attract the premium for only 1 year, students will only count if they are in their first year on the qualification. For those qualifications that attract the premium for 2 years, we will also count the number of students still studying those qualifications in the second year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA student cannot attract funding through both the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-core-maths-premium\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecore maths premium\u003c/a\u003e and the advanced maths premium in a funding year. Therefore, where a student is identified as eligible for both, the student remains in the count of eligible students for the core maths premium and we remove them from the count of eligible students for the advanced maths premium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-3-we-calculate-the-difference-between-eligible-student-numbers-in-the-baseline-and-the-comparison-year\"\u003eStep 3: we calculate the difference between eligible student numbers in the baseline and the comparison year\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe then compare the eligible student numbers against the baseline.

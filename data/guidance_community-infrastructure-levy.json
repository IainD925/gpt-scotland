Examples are simplified planning zones and local development orders (see related \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/when-is-permission-required#types-of-area-wide-permission\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Planning Policy Guidance on Local Development Orders\u003c/a\u003e).

Development which is the subject of a Lawful Development Certificate may be liable for the levy, depending on the circumstances. A lawful development certificate (granted under section 191 or 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) is often sought to confirm permitted development rights. It does not by itself trigger a levy payment because it is not a planning permission as defined in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/948/regulation/5/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eregulation 5\u003c/a\u003e. It simply confirms that no further application for planning permission is needed for the development described in the certificate. Where a certificate is sought to confirm permitted development rights, the normal levy provisions in respect of permitted development rights apply, and the grant of such a certificate is not relevant to whether or not, or when, the levy may be payable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a planning permission is phased, each phase of the development is treated as if it were a separate chargeable development for levy purposes (see \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/385/regulation/4/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eregulation 8(3A) as amended by 2014 Regulations\u003c/a\u003e).

Sources of data can include (but are not limited to): land registry records of transactions; real estate licensed software packages; real estate market reports; real estate research; estate agent websites; property auction results; valuation office agency data; public sector estate/property teams’ locally held evidence. They may also want to build on work undertaken to inform their assessments of land availability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, a charging authority should directly sample an appropriate range of types of sites across its area, in line with \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/viability\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eplanning practice guidance on viability\u003c/a\u003e. This will require support from local developers, landowners and site promoters.

For example, this might not be appropriate if the evidence pointed to setting a charge right at the margins of viability. There is room for some pragmatism. It would be appropriate to ensure that a ‘buffer’ or margin is included, so that the levy rate is able to support development when economic circumstances adjust.

If there is no change, the charging authority should re-issue the liability notice. If there is a change, the charging authority should calculate a new liability, following different processes, depending on whether the change results in an increase or decrease in liability. This is set out in more detail below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, in order to determine whether there is a change in the amount of levy payable for the development, the charging authority should compare the notional chargeable amounts for the section 73 permission and for the permission it amends (as required by \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1103/schedule/1/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraph 3 of Schedule 1\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo compare the notional chargeable amounts, the authority must calculate the chargeable amounts as if they were both permitted on the same date as the earlier permission. The value of any reliefs which have been granted should also be deducted. Reliefs should be calculated in accordance with \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1103/schedule/1/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraph 6 of Schedule 1\u003c/a\u003e. This approach ensures that when the authority compares the 2 permissions it is comparing like with like, and that any change in notional chargeable amounts is the result of a change in the planning permission or reliefs, rather than a change in indexation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, the charging authority must calculate the new CIL liability and how this is done will depend on the result from comparison of the notional chargeable amounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the notional chargeable amount is unchanged, the charging authority should re-issue the liability notice which relates to the earlier permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the notional chargeable amount for the section 73 permission is larger than the notional chargeable amount for the previous permission, the amount of levy payable should be calculated according to \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1103/schedule/1/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraph 4 of Schedule 1\u003c/a\u003e.  The calculation determines the additional gross internal area created by the section 73 permission and derives a chargeable amount for this based on the relevant rate(s) and the latest index figure for inflation. This means that any increase in liability, created by new elements of development, is charged at the latest indexed rate. This figure is added to the chargeable amount for the development permitted by the previous permission as set out in the most recent liability notice.  This ensures that while the new elements of the development are subject to the latest indexation, the other elements of the development continue to be charged at the rate/rates in place when those elements were granted consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the notional chargeable amount for the section 73 permission is smaller than the notional chargeable amount for the previous permission, the amount of levy payable should be calculated according to \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1103/schedule/1/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraph 5 of Schedule 1\u003c/a\u003e. The calculation determines the change in gross internal area. It arrives at a sum for the reduction in liability based on the rate and index for inflation for the year in which the original permission was granted. This figure should be deducted from the chargeable amount shown on the most recent levy notice for the previous permission for the development. This means that any reduction in liability occurs at the original indexed rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d6917b540f0b607c1d0b5a6/Flow_chart_3.pdf\"\u003eFlow chart showing calculation process \u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e526 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e1 page\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5e1edf62ed915d7c9ce69334/CIL_section_73_permissions_-_worked_examples.pdf\"\u003eWorked examples of calculating the chargeable amount where a chargeable development is amended through a section 73 permission\u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e279 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e17 pages\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 105 Reference ID: 25-105-20190901\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 01 09 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"para106\"\u003eWhat if I have an outline planning permission and a revised charging schedule is introduced in the area before reserved matters are approved?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a charging authority introduces a revised charging schedule, there may be some developments which have been granted an outline permission when the original charging schedule was in force, but which are granted reserved matters when the revised charging schedule comes into effect.

So when a local authority grants reliefs or exemptions under the CIL regulations it must do so in compliance with Subsidy Control requirements set out in the 2022 Act.  The Subsidy Control requirements are contained in Part 2 of the 2022 Act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Act requires that public authorities need to be satisfied that a subsidy is not prohibited, any additional conditions and/or procedural requirements are met and that the subsidy is compliant with the subsidy control principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSection 12(1) of the 2022 Act establishes a duty for public authorities to consider the subsidy control principles set out in Schedule 1 before deciding whether to grant a standalone subsidy (i.e. a subsidy not granted under a subsidy scheme). It also requires the public authority not to grant the subsidy unless they are of the view that it is consistent with the principles contained in Schedule 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut even if a subsidy is granted under a scheme – the scheme itself must be consistent with the Schedule 1 principles.  Section 12(3) places an obligation on public authorities, before making a subsidy scheme, to consider the principles in Schedule 1. It also requires public authorities not to make the scheme unless they are of the view that the subsidies provided for by the scheme will be consistent with the principles contained in Schedule 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSection 29 of the 2022 Act concerns Services of public economic interest (SPEI). SPEI’s are public services that would not be supplied (or would not be supplied under the required conditions) without public intervention, and which are of particular importance to society. An example of a SPEI could be social housing. A public authority can only award a subsidy for the delivery of a SPEI if it does so in a transparent manner and it is satisfied that the value of the subsidy is restricted to what is necessary to deliver that service. Public authorities should take into consideration the cost of delivering the service and what would be a reasonable profit for the enterprise delivering the task when deciding the value of the subsidy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSections 12(4) and (5) of the 2022 Act set out the steps a public authority has to take to award a SPEI subsidy in a transparent manner. Public authorities must review a SPEI subsidy to ensure it remains what is necessary to deliver the service and, if the compensation is above what is necessary, then the public authority must recover the excess. Public authorities must conduct such a review at least every three years and upon final delivery of the service of public economic interest. The subsidy control principles in Schedule 1 only apply to the award of a subsidy for the delivery of an SPEI insofar as applying them does not obstruct the delivery of the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 186 Reference ID: 25-186-20230104\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 04 01 2023 \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20221220162526/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/community-infrastructure-levy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSee previous version\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"summary-and-further-information\"\u003eSummary, and further information\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Subsidy Control Act 2022 provides for the detailed rules on awarding a particular kind of subsidy, how the award of subsidies are made, what is prohibited, and what procedural requirements apply.

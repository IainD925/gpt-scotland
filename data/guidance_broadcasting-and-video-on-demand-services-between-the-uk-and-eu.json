How this right is given effect in each country may depend on national law and how the ECTT has been implemented locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK must also permit freedom of reception for services that originate from all countries that are party to the ECTT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead the section \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/broadcasting-and-video-on-demand-services-between-the-uk-and-eu#about-avmsd-and-ectt\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAbout AVMSD and ECTT\u003c/a\u003e for more information about this legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your service is not available in the EU you do not need to take any action. Your Ofcom licence is still valid even though the UK has left he EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"uk-services-available-in-the-eu\"\u003eUK services available in the EU\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your service is available in the EU you may need 2 types of licences:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean Ofcom licence for services receivable in the UK and in other ECTT countries (this includes the 20 EU countries that have signed and ratified the ECTT)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elicences covering services receivable in EU countries that have not signed up to the ECTT\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EU’s ‘Notice to Stakeholders’ for audiovisual media services has confirmed that works originating in the UK continue to be classed as European Works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eu-services-available-in-the-uk\"\u003eEU services available in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 types of services coming to the UK from the EU. They are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eservices from countries that have signed and ratified the ECTT - no action is needed for these\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eservices from one of the 7 EU countries that have not signed and ratified the ECTT\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eServices that are from countries that have not signed and ratified the ECTT need a licence from Ofcom to be received in the UK. Alternatively, the broadcaster can change the way it operates so it falls within the jurisdiction of another ECTT country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK is committed to continued licence-free reception for TG4, RTÉ1 and RTÉ2 to reflect the commitments in the Good Friday agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ECTT does not have the same enforcement mechanisms as the AVMSD. There is a standing committee to resolve disputes, but this has not met since 2010. Article 26 of the ECTT also has provision for arbitration between ECTT parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-you-need-to-do\"\u003eWhat you need to do\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"check-your-licence-is-valid\"\u003eCheck your licence is valid\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind out whether your current licence will continue to be accepted in the EU countries where the service is available. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a valid licence or authorisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your service is only available in one of the 20 EU countries that are also ECTT parties, freedom of reception should be allowed. Seek local legal advice to check how national law deals with ECTT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOfcom licences should still be recognised but the process may depend on national law.

This means you need to comply with AVMSD jurisdiction rules. The regulation and authorisation of video on-demand service is determined locally. Seek local legal advice on the status of your service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you take no action, you are likely to be viewed as a third-country broadcaster broadcasting into the EU. Under AVMSD, this would mean that EU countries are free to impose further conditions on transmitting services into their territories through national laws, although subject to the provisions of the ECTT itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"qualifying-for-avmsd-jurisdiction\"\u003eQualifying for AVMSD jurisdiction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can still qualify for AVMSD jurisdiction in an EU Member State even if you keep your head office in the UK. Under AVMSD, if a provider’s editorial decisions are taken in an EU country, the provider will fall under the jurisdiction of that country, if a significant part of its workforce is located there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-to-tell-if-your-organisation-is-established-within-an-eu-country-under-avmsd\"\u003eHow to tell if your organisation is established within an EU country under AVMSD\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA service provider is considered established within an EU country (Article 2 (3) AVMSD) when its head office and editorial decisions for a service are taken within an EU country. If the head office is in one location but editorial decisions are taken in another EU country, establishment is based on the location of the office where a significant part of the workforce is located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a significant part of the workforce is in both locations, establishment is based on the location of the head office. For example, if a service has its head office in one EU country but editorial decisions are taken in another EU country, and a significant part of the workforce is in both EU countries, the country with the head office will have jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeek local legal advice on the establishment requirements in the EU country concerned. If you do not have a significant workforce within an EU country, the technical criteria may still apply, as set out in Article 2 (4) AVMSD:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eif a service is provided via a satellite uplink in an EU country then jurisdiction would fall to that country\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eif there is more than one uplink, jurisdiction will fall to the EU country where the first uplink was established\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eif the uplink is in the UK, the jurisdiction will fall to the EU country which operates the relevant satellite capacity\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn most cases, satellite capacity would either be Luxembourg or France, as the majority of EU broadcasting satellites are operated by these 2 countries. These countries have different notification systems. Contact the local regulator to check the local regulatory requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-avmsd-and-ectt\"\u003eAbout AVMSD and ECTT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) sets out a country of origin principle, where providers of broadcasting channels and video on-demand services based in one country are only subject to one set of rules and regulations from a ‘country of origin’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the UK a broadcasting licence issued by Ofcom is valid in the whole of the EU, so providers only need to comply with Ofcom rules, regardless of where the licensed service is received within the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK, along with 20 other EU countries, is a signatory to the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Transfrontier Television (ECTT) which came into force in 1993. EU countries that have signed and ratified the ECTT are Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eECTT guarantees freedom of reception between parties and sets out that they must not restrict the retransmission of compliant programmes within their territories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, ECTT sets out that EU countries should apply the AVMSD not ECTT between each other. This means that even the EU countries who have signed ECTT observe only AVMSD rules inside the single market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

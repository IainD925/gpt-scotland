In-year growth funding is exceptional and is intended only for those with significant recruitment above their allocation, to provide a contribution to the additional in-year costs. It also does not fund increases in programme size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis process does not apply to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-individualised-learner-record-ilr-returns\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eindependent learning providers (ILPs) for whom there is a separate reconciliation process\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis process is entirely data driven; we do not accept business cases for exceptional in-year growth. We make growth awards on the assumption that the in-year data used is materially accurate. If later data returns (usually the R14) show that the in-year data returns are inaccurate, we will recover some or all of the in-year growth award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach year, we revisit the methodology for awarding growth and the thresholds at which individual institutions become eligible for a growth award. The key considerations of this process are the levels of over-delivery in the sector and affordability. This year, in recognition of the volatility in recruitment during and following the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we have not made an adjustment to the growth award for under-delivery in the previous year (2021 to 2022). All other elements of the methodology will remain unchanged from 2021 to 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe removal of the adjustment for previous under-delivery is intended for 2022 to 2023 only, and the expectation is that in 2023 to 2024 we will again adjust growth awards for under-delivery in the previous year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the overall method used this year does not set a precedent for the method used or thresholds in place in future years. Each year is assessed independently with thresholds and marginal rates dependent on levels of over-delivery and affordability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe calculation of growth awards for 2022 to 2023 is a 3-step process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCalculate over-delivery (in numbers of students)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFrom the over-delivery, calculate growth\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eApply the growth award minimum\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-1-over-delivery\"\u003eStep 1.

Growth calculation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 thresholds, and we fund over-delivery at different marginal rates for the over-delivery above each threshold. The 2 thresholds are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elower threshold - 7.5% of the 2022 to 2023 allocated student number, with a minimum of 25 students and a maximum of 100 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eupper threshold - 15% of the 2022 to 2023 allocated student number with a minimum of 50 students and a maximum of 200 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not fund over-delivery below the lower threshold. We fund the over-delivery between the lower and upper thresholds at 100% of the average funding per student. We fund the over-delivery above the upper threshold at 50% of the average funding per student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn institution with an allocation of 2,000 students would have a lower threshold of 100 students and an upper threshold of 200 students.

This means we fund the 50% of 50 students, i.e. 25 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth funding for this institution would be a total of 125 students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"step-3-minimum-growth-award\"\u003eStep 3.

We make growth awards on the assumption that the in-year data used is materially accurate.

CFEs should refer to the “exceptional in-year growth for student numbers section” above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe general principles for calculating of programme funding increases under the national 16 to 19 funding formula (element 1 growth) are the same as set out above. However, we calculate over-delivery as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e2022 to 2023 R04 students less the 2022 to 2023 allocated students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe thresholds are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elower threshold - 7.5% of the 2022 to 2023 allocated student number, with a minimum of 5 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eupper threshold - 15% of the 2022 to 2023 allocated student number with a minimum of 10 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn SPI with an allocation of 80 students would have a lower threshold of 6 students and an upper threshold of 12 students. If the over-delivery is 20 students, we calculate the growth as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery below the lower threshold – not funded. This means we would not fund the first 6 students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery between the lower and upper thresholds – funded at 100%. This means we would fund 6 students at 100%\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eover-delivery above the upper threshold – funded at 50%. This means we would fund 8 students at 50%, i.e. 4 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth funding for this institution would be a total of 10 students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs above, this year we have not made a deduction for under-delivery in the previous year. There is no minimum growth award for element 1 growth for SPIs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"element-2-growth-for-spis-and-cfes\"\u003eElement 2 growth for SPIs and CFEs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe calculate element 2 over delivery as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e2022 to 2023 R04 element 2 students less 2022 to 2023 allocated element 2 students\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe threshold used to calculate growth awards depends on the number of element 2 students funded in the 2022 to 2023 allocation. If over-delivery exceeds the threshold, we will fund all over-delivery above the threshold at the full annual rate of £6,000 per place. There are no deductions for previous under-delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"spiscfes-with-a-2022-to-2023-allocation-of-up-to-and-including-50-high-needs-students\"\u003e1. SPIs/CFEs with a 2022 to 2023 allocation of up to and including 50 high needs students\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe threshold will be 5% of the allocated element 2 places. We will fund high needs student places above the threshold at £6,000 per place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo illustrate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn SPI/CFE has an allocation of 40 element 2 places, and records 50 in their ILR R04 return (an additional 10 high needs students). The threshold is calculated as 5% of 40 = 2. Therefore, we will provide additional element 2 funding of £48,000 (8 × £6,000).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"spiscfes-with-a-2022-to-2023-allocation-of-51-or-more-high-needs-students\"\u003e2.

Over-delivery above this threshold will be funded at £6,000 per place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo illustrate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn SPI/CFE has an allocation based on 72 high needs students; therefore, the threshold is 7.2 (as 10% of 72 is lower than 10). They have recorded 90 high needs students in their ILR R04, therefore over-delivery is 18 students. The growth is calculated as 18 minus 7.2 = 10.8, which is rounded to 11 students (as we round to the nearest whole number) × £6,000 = £66,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"free-meals-in-further-education-fe-and-bursary-in-year-growth\"\u003eFree meals in further education (FE) and bursary in-year growth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth bursary and free meals in FE allocations are linked to the allocated student number, so an increased student number allocation resulting from the exceptional in-year growth for student numbers process may also result in increased bursary and free meals allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we have:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ereleased additional bursary funding outside the main growth process, where analysis of the data suggested that an increased student number could put an institution’s bursary allocation under considerable pressure\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ereleased additional free meals in FE funding to ensure that institutions have sufficient funding to support the students they recorded as eligible for, and in receipt of free meals, in their in-year data return\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eremoved the cap on bursary allocations that was introduced in 2020 to 2021 academic year as part of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2023-to-2024-academic-year/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2023-to-2024-academic-year\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etransitional arrangements for bursary funding\u003c/a\u003e.

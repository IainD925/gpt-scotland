By following designated standards, manufacturers can claim, ‘presumption of conformity’ (which can be countered by evidence) with the corresponding essential requirements. Designated standards do not replace the essential requirements and manufacturers retain full responsibility for ensuring the applicable GB law is met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA designated standard is a standard, developed by consensus, which is recognised by government in part or in full by publishing its reference on GOV.UK in a formal notice of publication. Links are provided on this page to all pages on GOV.UK on which formal notices of publication are made available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the GB market, and depending on the product, a designated standard can be a standard adopted by any of the recognised standardisation bodies (the British Standards Institution (BSI), European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)) or by international standardising bodies (including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e The content of the standard is the responsibility of the recognised standardisation bodies. As the UK’s National Standards Body, BSI represents the interests of UK stakeholders in the development of international and regional European (not EU) standards. We encourage UK stakeholders to shape the content of a standard at the earliest stage so that when it is considered for designation there is minimal risk it will not give full coverage of the relevant essential requirements.

The government ensures that the standards designated for the GB market meet the required levels of safety or energy efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo promote consistency and guidance on the designation of standards, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) leads and co-ordinates the designation process across government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBSI updates OPSS on new or revised standards that can be considered for designation. The government assesses whether the standards put forward are suitable for the purpose of providing a presumption of conformity to relevant essential requirements in GB law. This information is shared by OPSS with the relevant government departments and agencies responsible for designation decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders wishing to propose a standard for designation should approach BSI in the first instance so that the relevant technical committee can assess if the standard is suitable to put forward for designation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen deciding if a standard is appropriate for designation, the responsible government department or agency will assess how far it covers the essential requirements set out in the relevant GB legislation. This assessment compares the provisions of the standard with the requirements of the regulation. It does not assess the quality of the standard nor its technical adequacy, which is the responsibility of BSI. If the government requires clarification on a specific issue about the standard’s suitability for designation, it will contact the appropriate technical committee through BSI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGovernment may decide to designate a standard in full; not to designate; or, to designate with restriction. Any such restrictions will be published on GOV.UK. It is important that stakeholders look at published notices for references that may be subject to restrictions in respect of essential requirements in GB law. Where a standard that is designated replaces an existing designated standard, there is a transition period during which both the new designated standard and the superseded standard give a presumption of conformity. This transition period will be made clear in the relevant published notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the application of a designated standard will give a presumption of conformity to the relevant essential requirements. There may be instances where the reference to a designated standard is accompanied by an ‘Informative Note’. The government uses informative notes as guidance to identify an error in the standard (for example where an incorrect date has been used), to provide a clarification on an ambiguity, or to advise additional or alternative actions for business to consider outside of the standard. Where additional actions are advised, it is intended to support businesses in their approach in understanding and managing risks that they may identify with their products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOPSS maintains all designated standards pages on GOV.UK and carries out the administrative function of publishing references to standards following internal approval or when other departments and agencies have decided to designate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government makes its proposals to publish references to standards publicly available for 28 days, to provide an opportunity for interested parties to object if they have reason to believe that a standard proposed for designation does not meet GB essential requirements, either fully or partly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/designated-standards-new-or-amended-notices-of-publication\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDesignated standards: new or amended notices of publication\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe references will be published to designate the standards on day 29, unless the proposal is withdrawn or amended before that date, or an objection to designation is received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe publication of references is postponed if an objection against a standard proposed for designation alleges that it does not adequately cover the relevant essential legal requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note:\u003c/strong\u003e The designation process cannot change the content of a standard – this can only be done by the standards bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"references-of-designated-standards\"\u003eReferences of designated standards\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDesignated standards are prefixed “BS”, “EN”, “EN ISO” or “EN IEC”. The “EN” prefix indicates that the standard has been adopted by a regional European standardising body. Where the designated standard specified in the notice of publication is prefixed “EN” it is acceptable to reference this version in technical documentation, or a version of the same standard with a national prefix. This is because regional European standards are adopted identically by the 34 national members of CEN and CENELEC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example: BS EN 71-1:2014+A1:2018, DIN EN 71-1:2014+A1:2018, or simply EN 71-1:2014+A1:2018 are all equally acceptable. (‘DIN’ indicates the German Institute for Standardization.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the essential legal requirements in GB remain the same as the equivalent EU law, the informative Annex ZA/ZZ and any references to EU law in designated standards should be read as applying to the legislation for GB in the same way, subject to any restrictions or points made in the relevant notice of publication. This will change if and when the essential requirements in GB change. We have asked BSI to ensure that any new or revised designated standards map across to the essential requirements in GB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2

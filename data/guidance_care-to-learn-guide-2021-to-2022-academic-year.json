Organisations must be able to show they comply with it at any audit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOrganisations who need further or more detailed help should contact the Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) who administer C2L on behalf of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L provides funding for childcare to help young parents (defined as those aged under 20) continue in education after the birth of a child. The scheme provides funding for childcare whilst the young parent is engaged in a study programme and is not able to provide care for their child.  It can also help the young parent with any additional travel costs involved in taking the child to the childcare provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L provides funding for childcare whilst young parents are on work placements or industry placements, where these are a defined part of the study programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L pays up to a maximum amount of £160 per child, per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child, per week in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible, the young parents study programme must have some direct public funding and their childcare provision must be registered with Ofsted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo receive C2L, the young parent, their education institution and their childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents must complete and submit a new application each academic year even if their study programme runs for more than one year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents should apply for C2L before the start of their study programme or as soon as possible after they start. If young parents apply after the start of their study programme, it is important they know that payments can only be backdated to the beginning of their study programme if their application is received within 28 days of the start date. For any applications received outside of this timeframe payments will only begin from the Monday of the week the SBSS receive the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders should tell young parents about the availability of financial support for childcare through C2L to help them make more informed decisions about their options.

This funding must be paid directly to the education institution for the delivery of the young parents study programme. The source of the public funding might be a government department (such as from ESFA on behalf of Department for Education), an independent grant administrator of government funding (like the Arts Council or Sports England) or a local authority.  It can also include funding awarded from the Big Lottery Fund or from charities, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA study programme is a defined programme of activities with a specified duration that leads to a set of outcomes agreed with the student.  This does not mean there has to be a formal qualification but there must be a learning agreement between the young parent and the education institution.  ESFA may request a copy of the agreement as part of its audit and assurance processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost students who receive C2L follow post-16 study programmes at ESFA funded institutions.  These programmes generally last for one or two years. A small number of young parents take part in non-accredited day sessions and short programmes within the community such as first aid, healthy eating and parenting.  These programmes generally last for a few weeks or months and funding can be from a variety of sources. Where funding is not directly provided by ESFA, the education institution must provide a copy of the agreement between the education institution and the funding body with their part of the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"study-programme-types\"\u003eStudy programme types\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of study programmes that young parents receiving C2L are enrolled on include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eschool and college study programmes including GCSEs, A levels, BTECs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enon accredited day sessions and short programmes such as first aid, healthy eating and parenting\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etraineeships for young people not currently in a job who have little work experience but whom providers and employers believe have a reasonable chance of being ready for employment or an apprenticeship within 6 months\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efurther education (FE) study programmes in a higher education (HE) institution, including access courses and diplomas\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efoundation HE courses where they are followed at an FE institution, for example, a BTEC diploma\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following study programmes are not eligible for C2L:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprivately funded education, for example, at an independent school or other institution where students are required to pay tuition fees\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003evoluntary work that is not a required part of an agreed study programme\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapprenticeships, because apprentices are paid by their employer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHE courses in an HE institution or FE institution, including courses leading to a first degree, HND, HNC, diploma in HE, foundation degree or initial teacher training\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esocial activities/groups where no actual programme of study takes place\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany instances where a young parent is still looking after their child, for example, while they are undertaking a study programme with a childcare provider\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"study-programme-duration\"\u003eStudy programme duration\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L will provide help with childcare costs for the duration of the young parents study programme.

This can give in-depth insight into a particular context, group or culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEthnography uses different research techniques, which may include observations, taking field notes, informal conversations, interviews, document analysis, surveys, filming and photography. More rapid approaches have been developed in recent years, some of which include digital methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse ethnography to describe how a particular group or community works. For example, you could focus on the experiences of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprofessionals delivering a digital health service\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echanges in routine practices in health services because of digital tools\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epatients living with a health condition and using digital tools\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEthnography investigates the whole setting rather than a digital product in isolation. It focuses on exploring experiences (how someone might use the product in practice), not testing hypotheses. It is usually informed by specific research questions and theory. It can involve detailed examination of one or a few cases – these might be people or places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use an ethnography to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einform service development (formative or iterative evaluation), by assessing needs or understanding how current systems work\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edescribe how your service works (summative evaluation)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pros\"\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBenefits include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can offer a deeper understanding of experiences and local practices than quantitative studies or qualitative studies that only rely on interviewing (what people do versus what they say)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can uncover experiences, knowledge and perspectives that other methods miss out because of its real world focus and flexible approach\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can give a voice to seldom-heard groups and perspectives that have been marginalised or overlooked\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can uncover unintended consequences of changes made\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cons\"\u003eCons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDrawbacks include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit usually involves extensive field work – this is time-consuming and needs experience, although rapid ethnographic approaches are increasingly being used\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can be subjective because it’s very dependent on the evaluator’s interpretation and skills\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enegotiating permissions and access to carry out observational work can be difficult\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-an-ethnography\"\u003eHow to carry out an ethnography\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEthnography includes a range of specific techniques. You will need to decide which methods to use. This will depend on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe evaluation question\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe setting being studied\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe availability of participants and materials\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch may include document analysis – for example, reading all documents from board meetings of a health service, or starting with an organisational chart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe researcher will place themself in the setting being studied. It’s important that they establish good relations with the group or community and build trust. The researcher may identify knowledgeable informants who can act as a way in to understanding and interacting with the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou might select participants to cover the range of different experiences. In ethnography, the researcher can evolve their approach to data collection as the study goes on or collect data opportunistically. The researcher analyses the emerging data flexibly, identifying themes and any gaps or questions that require further study.\nOften, the researcher will sit in a clinic, spend time in organisations or visit patient’s homes. Digital ethnography can involve interacting with participants in a virtual space. The researcher observes events and talks to participants, either in a more formal way like a scheduled interview, or more informally during observations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eField notes are usually made by the researcher. These are qualitative notes recorded during or soon after observations. They include both factual information (times, dates, behaviour observed, comments by participant) and reflections and interpretations by the researcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEthnographic research is interpretive, so it can be subjective. To counter this, researchers often try to examine their own reasoning and involvement, recording it and working through any assumptions or difficulties that come up (this is called critical reflexivity). They often involve others in the evaluation team to sense-check their findings. They may validate findings by sharing their interpretations with participants, opening them up for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData analysis tends to involve reading and re-reading the research materials using a constant comparison approach, where each finding is compared with existing findings. This is a sense-making process, drawing on the different types of evidence collected. It will often be a form of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analyse-your-data-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethematic analysis\u003c/a\u003e. Your analysis might draw on existing theory or you may develop a new theory that lets you be more responsive to the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-a-rapid-ethnography-of-patient-portal-use\"\u003eExample: a rapid ethnography of patient portal use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAckerman and others (2017), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/5/903/3072321\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMeaningful use in the safety net: a rapid ethnography of patient portal implementation at five community health centers in California\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team wanted to examine the implementation of patient portals (also known as Personal Health Records) in US healthcare services for low-income populations.

Patients who were present gave informed consent. A university ethics committee decided that the study didn’t require \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carry-out-your-evaluation-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eethics approval\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe health systems were putting in considerable effort to implement the portals, encouraging staff support and changing work patterns to accommodate portal-related work. They achieved or were close to achieving targets that released central funding, which were focused on registrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, staff were not sure how to achieve real impact in their patients’ lives with a portal that was not necessarily relevant to patients. Patients rarely used the portal and faced many barriers to doing so.

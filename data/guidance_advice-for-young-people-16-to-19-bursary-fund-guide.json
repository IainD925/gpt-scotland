Your study must also meet some conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"your-age\"\u003eYour age\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must be aged 16 or over but under 19 at 31 August 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re aged 19 or over you will only be eligible to receive a discretionary bursary if you are continuing on a study programme you began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’) or have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther students aged over 19 may be able to get other support for older/adult students. Your education institution will tell you what you can apply for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo students aged 19 or over are eligible for bursaries for vulnerable groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"your-residency\"\u003eYour residency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must meet the residency conditions to get a bursary.

Your institution will check if your study programme meets the conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re on an apprenticeship programme, or any waged training, you’re classed as being employed, rather than in education and aren’t eligible for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can be studying full or part time. Your institution will look at the amount of time you’re studying when they’re deciding if you will get a payment and how much you will get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re studying on a publicly funded distance learning course you will probably not have the kind of costs the bursary fund is designed to cover, like transport, equipment and uniforms.   If you do want to apply, you should talk to your education institution.  They will look at your individual case and let you know if you might be eligible for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you go to an independent institution that charges fees, you won’t normally get a bursary. However, if your local authority has referred you to the institution and they pay your fees, you may be able to apply. You should talk to your education institution about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"finding-out-if-you-are-eligible-for-the-bursary-for-vulnerable-groups\"\u003eFinding out if you are eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are in one of the groups below, you can apply for a vulnerable bursary:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein care\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecare leavers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egetting Income Support, or Universal Credit because you’re financially supporting yourself or are financially supporting yourself and someone who is dependent on you and living with you, for example, your child or your partner\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egetting Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments and Employment and Support Allowance or Universal Credit.  You must be getting both benefits in your own right\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to understand that your institution may decide that even though you may be eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups because you’re in one or more of the defined groups you don’t actually need help from the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bursary fund is to provide help with costs so you can participate in education.  If you don’t have any actual financial need, for example, because your local authority is already meeting your costs or because you’re on a distance learning programme and don’t have any travel or uniform costs; your institution may decide not to award you a bursary, or to award you a lower amount of bursary. If this the case, they will explain their decision to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"providing-proof-that-youre-eligible-for-the-bursary-for-vulnerable-groups\"\u003eProviding proof that you’re eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour institution will need proof that you’re eligible. They will tell you what they need from you. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor students who are in care or a care leaver, written confirmation from the local authority that looks after you or provides your leaving care services\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor students getting Income Support or Universal Credit, a copy of your Income Support or Universal Credit award notice (you must be entitled to the benefits in your own right). The evidence must confirm that you can be in further education or training. If you’re getting Universal Credit your institution will also need to see a tenancy agreement in your name, a child benefit receipt, children’s birth certificates, utility bills etc\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor students getting Universal Credit (UC)/Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payments, a copy of your UC claim that confirms which ESA group you’ve been placed in. You will also need to provide evidence that you’re receiving Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"finding-out-if-you-are-eligible-for-the-discretionary-bursary\"\u003eFinding out if you are eligible for the discretionary bursary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you aren’t in one of the defined vulnerable groups, but you need financial help to stay in education, you can apply for a discretionary bursary from your education institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour education institution is responsible for setting the criteria they use for discretionary bursaries. The criteria they use will focus on making sure bursary funds are targeted at students who need the most help to stay in education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTheir criteria might be based on your family’s income; if your parents get benefits or if you currently receive free school meals or have had them in the past.  Each institution has their own 16 to 19 Bursary Fund policy that they publish on their website or can give to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour institution may ask for evidence of your family’s household income when you apply. Examples of what they might ask for include a letter from the Department of Work and Pensions showing receipt of benefits, a P60, a Tax Credit Award Notice or 3 months’ worth of pay slips or bank account statements\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"applying\"\u003eApplying\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to contact student services or your tutor at your education institution to apply. They will tell you what to do.  Most institutions put information about the bursary fund on their website and on posters around school or college; all of these should tell you how to apply, including if there’s any particular date they’ve set for looking at applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should apply as soon as you know where you’re going to study. The sooner you apply, the sooner your support can start. Some institutions may have limited funds available and may allocate funding on a first come first served basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to understand that your bursary application is a legal document.  If you or your parents or carers give false or incomplete information on your application you may be committing fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your institution thinks this is the case they may pass details of your application to the Department for Education or the police. You and your parents or carers could be prosecuted and your institution will ask you to pay back any bursary payments you should not have had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-much-you-will-be-paid-if-youre-eligible\"\u003eHow much you will be paid if you’re eligible\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups, you could get up to £1,200 if you study full time for a minimum of 30 weeks. If your course is only for a few hours a week or less than 30 weeks, you will get less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to remember you won’t necessarily get £1,200 if you’re in one of the specific vulnerable groups if your institution assesses you don’t have any actual financial need.  This might be because your costs are already covered from another source or because you have no costs.  Your institution will consider your circumstances when you apply and will explain any decision they make to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour institution will decide how much discretionary bursary they award you, depending on your household income and your circumstances.  The criteria they apply should be set out in the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can pay bursaries in-kind rather than cash. This means they may give you a travel pass, voucher or credits for meals, required books and required equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour institution can specify that you must return books and equipment at the end of your study programme so they can be used again by other students. They can also say what you can spend the bursary on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rules-and-conditions-for-payment\"\u003eRules and conditions for payment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEducation institutions usually set conditions on your bursary payments. These are rules you need to stick to so you can carry on getting support from the bursary fund. The conditions they set can cover attendance or standards of behaviour. If you don’t stick to the rules the institution may stop your payments. Some institutions will ask you to sign a form to confirm that you’ve understood the rules they’ve set and what will happen if you break them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re ill or are absent from your institution for another reason this may affect your payments.  Your education institution will give you more information about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"who-will-know-i-get-a-bursary\"\u003eWho will know I get a bursary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour application is confidential and our education institution should make sure you’re not singled out as getting a bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re worried, talk to student support services or your tutor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-help-to-stay-in-education\"\u003eOther help to stay in education\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome institutions keep some bursary funds for students who need emergency help or different types of help during the year because their circumstances have changed.  Others provide one-off support through separate funds that aren’t connected to the bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your circumstances change and you think you need more help speak to your education institution straight away. They will be able to tell you what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a young parent you can apply for a bursary and for help from \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/care-to-learn\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCare to Learn\u003c/a\u003e for help with childcare costs whilst you study.

Your education institution will use the information you give them confidentially so you can talk to them about your caring responsibilities when you’re applying for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"young-offenders\"\u003eYoung offenders\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re a young offender you can apply for a bursary if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’re serving a non-custodial sentence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’ve been released early from a custodial sentence (except on temporary licence)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’ve been remanded to a non secure institution\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re eligible, institutions will usually provide you with in-kind support like a travel pass, course material or a meal instead of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t apply if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’re serving a custodial sentence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’ve been released from a custodial sentence on temporary licence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’ve been remanded to a secure institution\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"impact-on-dwp-benefits\"\u003eImpact on DWP benefits\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBursary fund payments don’t affect your right to Department of Works and Pensions income-related benefits (like Income Support or Universal Credit for example).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you’re getting Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments and Employment Support Allowance or Universal Credit, your parents can’t get certain benefits (like child benefit) for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"i-live-in-scotland--am-i-eligible\"\u003eI live in Scotland – am I eligible?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you live in Scotland and travel to England to study, you should contact your home local authority in Scotland to apply for Scottish EMA.

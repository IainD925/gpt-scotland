The surcharge applies to the majority of criminal sentences and the amount the offender is required to pay will vary, depending on the severity of the sentence and the age of the offender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe surcharge does not apply if the court discharges the person absolutely or makes an order under the Mental Health Act 1983.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of the surcharge is to ensure that offenders hold some responsibility towards the cost of supporting victims and witnesses.

It compensates victims with physical or mental injury caused by a violent crime occurring in Great Britain. It also compensates bereaved families of victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme defines a crime of violence as a physical attack, a sexual assault, a threat causing fear of immediate violence, or an act or omission of a violent nature which causes physical injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompensation payments can only be made for qualifying injuries which are set out in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/808343/criminal-injuries-compensation-scheme-2012.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eannex E of the scheme\u003c/a\u003e.

This type of claim can include psychological harm caused to the victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should seek professional advice if considering this option as the process is more complex than the criminal injuries compensation scheme and can expose you to cost risks, especially if the defendant does not have enough money to pay compensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal injury claims must be brought within 3 years of the criminal offence, although the courts may agree to extend this (for example, in historic child sex abuse claims).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible to also seek advice on funding a civil claim. For example, by entering into a conditional fee agreement (‘no-win, no-fee’ agreement) where legal costs do not have to be paid on losing a claim (although you may be liable for the other parties’ costs in those circumstances).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe civil courts require the claimant to prove the defendant was responsible for the injury/loss suffered, and the claim may be challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be possible to seek this form of compensation even where there was no conviction for the offence in the criminal courts, as the tests used by the civil courts are different. Seeking professional advice is even more important for this type of claim as any civil claim brings costs risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"effect-of-compensation-order-on-subsequent-award-of-damages-in-civil-proceedings-or-under-the-scheme\"\u003eEffect of compensation order on subsequent award of damages in civil proceedings or under the scheme\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny monies received by the victim from the offender as part of a compensation order given by the criminal courts, will normally be deducted from any subsequent award made in civil court proceedings, or any award made under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

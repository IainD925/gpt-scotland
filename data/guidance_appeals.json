Where objectors are defending their rights, or protecting their interests, which are the subject of a compulsory purchase or analogous order, they may have costs awarded in their favour if the order does not proceed or is not confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of this Part, “remaining objector” means a person who is defending  their rights, or protecting their interests, which are the subject of a compulsory purchase or analogous order, and who has made a “remaining objection” within the meaning of section 13A(1) of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCosts will be awarded in favour of a successful remaining objector unless there are exceptional reasons for not making an award.  The award will be made by the Secretary of State against the authority which made the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, the following conditions must be met for an award to be made on the basis of a successful objection:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) the claimant must have made a remaining objection and have either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eattended (or been represented at) an inquiry (or, if applicable, a hearing at which the objection was heard); or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esubmitted a written representation which was considered as part of the written procedure; and\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) the objection must have been sustained by the confirming authority’s refusal to confirm the order or by its decision to exclude the whole or part of the claimant’s property from the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, a remaining objection will be successful and an award of costs may be made in the claimant’s favour if an inquiry is cancelled because the acquiring authority have decided not to proceed with the order, or a claimant has not appeared at an inquiry having made an arrangement for their land to be excluded from the order.

The details of the level of costs are then a matter for negotiation between parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 058 Reference ID: 16-058-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-an-award-be-made-for-unreasonable-behaviour\"\u003eCan an award be made for unreasonable behaviour?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn award of costs cannot be made both on grounds of success and unreasonable behaviour in such cases; but an award to a successful objector may be reduced if they have acted unreasonably and caused unnecessary expense in the proceedings – as, for example, where their conduct leads to an adjournment which ought not to have been necessary\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 059 Reference ID: 16-059-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-an-award-of-costs-be-made-to-an-unsuccessful-objector\"\u003eCan an award of costs be made to an unsuccessful objector?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, an award of costs may be made to an unsuccessful remaining objector or to an order-making authority because of unreasonable behaviour by the other party. In practice, such an award is likely to relate to procedural matters, such as failing to submit grounds of objection or serve a statement of case, resulting in unnecessary expense – for example, because the inquiry has to be adjourned or is unnecessarily prolonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn application for costs (on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour) should be made to the Inspector at the inquiry or hearing, or in writing if appropriate. The Inspector may also initiate an award of costs if they consider a party has behaved unreasonably and an application is not made. The Inspector will provide a recommendation to the confirming authority, usually the Secretary of State, for a decision on whether to award costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 060 Reference ID: 16-060-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-an-award-of-costs-be-made-against-interested-parties\"\u003eCan an award of costs be made against interested parties?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.

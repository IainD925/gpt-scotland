Institutions do this at audition, based on students’ talent and potential to succeed in the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions assess the amount of financial support a student is entitled to, based on nationally set income bands. Household income is used to determine the level of financial support for both fees and living costs (maintenance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions will normally use the income assessment undertaken at the beginning of the students’ first academic year on the TCL diploma course to set the amount of tuition fee support for the whole of their course. However, an income assessment must be undertaken each year to establish the amount of living costs support the student is entitled to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are required to undertake income assessments for new starters (for both tuition fees and living costs) and for students who are returning for their second and third year (for living costs only) using the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dance-and-drama-awards-income-scales\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eincome bands\u003c/a\u003e for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.

This includes deciding whether they wish to allocate all the funding or hold a small contingency fund to respond to issues later in the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA has based 2021 to 2022 academic year DaDA allocations on data from student numbers and spend from the last full year (the 2019 to 2020 academic year). Projected numbers for the 2020 to 2021 academic year have also been factored in. Each institution should be able to afford to support a similar number of students this academic year as they have done previously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will make allocation payments in 2 instalments: approximately two-thirds in August 2021 and the remaining one-third in April 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use up to 5% of the total allocation of funding for administration costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"underspends-and-spending-flexibility\"\u003eUnderspends and spending flexibility\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will reconcile any underspent funds from institutions in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. Institutions cannot carry under-spends forward into future years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs in previous academic years, institutions may use discretion and flexibility in their allocated DaDA funding. They can do this to provide partial funding for talented students if they have insufficient funds to provide the full support that the student would have been eligible to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they communicate to students and parents how they are using this flexibility so that their use of DaDA funding is clear and transparent. Institutions must ensure that they only give out partial funding awards after all successful students applying for DaDA have been fully income assessed and the full DaDA funding process has been completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"application-income-assessment-and-payment-of-dada\"\u003eApplication, income assessment and payment of DaDA\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"dada-funding\"\u003eDaDA funding\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important criterion in allocating DaDA funding is that institutions identify at audition those students with the most potential to succeed in the profession based on their talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen auditioning students, institutions must implement ‘The Code of Practice for Auditions and Interviews’ produced by the Council for Dance, Drama and Musical Theatre (CDMT).

The flowchart is for information only and ESFA recognises that processes may vary in individual institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are reminded that CDMT will continue to manage the clearing process for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"applying-for-dada-funding\"\u003eApplying for DaDA funding\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should use the application forms supplied by ESFA when assessing the amount of DaDA funding a student is eligible to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe self-declaration of income form enables institutions to carry out an initial assessment of the student’s household income and determine an indicative level of support they may be eligible to receive. The student should complete this form when they are offered a provisional place at the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may make provisional DaDA funding offers at this stage. Any provisional amount of DaDA funding stated by the institution to the student must be clearly explained to the student as based on the information they supplied on the self-declaration form. The institution must make clear that the funding amount quoted to them is not guaranteed but is subject to verification and confirmation via the main DaDA application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a student has formally accepted their place, they must complete the main DaDA application form to determine the final amount of funding they are eligible to receive. Institutions can only confirm funding after they have undertaken the full income assessment using the information from the main application form and appropriate supporting evidence.

The letter they give or send to the student should also set out details of their appeals procedure. If the student believes that the process used to come to the decision contains irregularities, they must be given the right to appeal under the institution’s procedures. If the institution is found to be in error, they must compensate the student appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"payment-of-dada-funding-to-students\"\u003ePayment of DaDA funding to students\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should make living costs payments directly to students once they have been fully assessed as eligible for DaDA. Institutions are free to determine the frequency of payments to students; however, it is recommended that payments are made in instalments, for example, on a termly basis. This ensures students do not receive funding they are not entitled to, if, for example, they withdraw from their course part way through the year. Where an institution issues a large amount of funding to a student, they should be aware that this is at their own risk. No additional funding can be claimed from ESFA in the event of any overpayment to students by institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should make clear to students that continued receipt of DaDA is conditional on them meeting agreed standards set by the institutions, for example, relating to attendance, behaviour and progression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"disabled-students-allowance-dsa\"\u003eDisabled Students Allowance (DSA)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDSA can provide support for the extra costs a student may incur as a direct result of a disability, mental health condition or specific learning difficulty.

They must provide any such person with all the facilities they may reasonably require for making an inspection as and when required, in line with Ofsted powers of entry and access to documents and its Common Inspection Framework in accordance with section 131 and 132 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly institutions whose provision is assessed as Outstanding (Grade 1) or Good (Grade 2) at Ofsted inspection will be eligible to offer DaDA funding.

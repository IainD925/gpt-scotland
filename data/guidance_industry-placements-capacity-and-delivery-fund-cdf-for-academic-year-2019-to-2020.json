In response to this feedback, we have identified a series of additional models and approaches which can be used to ensure placements are high quality, meaningful and deliverable across different industries as well as being accessible for all students. The framework comprises models which are applicable to all routes as well as a number of industry-specific models, as listed below. Therefore, we have adapted the principles that providers work to for 2019 to 2020 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA summary of the new models of delivery are listed here, full details are included in the relevant sections below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"applicable-to-all-placements\"\u003eApplicable to all placements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIndustry Placement across 2 employers: A single industry placement (average 350 hours, minimum 315 hours) can be split across 2 employers if needed\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ework taster activities: Students can undertake short work taster activities, of up to 35 hours in total, to help them decide on an area in which to specialise. These can be counted towards a student’s total number of placement hours of average 350 hours, and minimum of 315 hours\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSEND: A provider’s on-site facilities can now be used for students with Special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) for up to 105 hours where they are occupationally relevant to the student’s field of study. This must be in the best interests of the student and carefully aligned to their learning and development objectives\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYoung Offenders: On site facilities can be used for the full duration of placements for young offenders\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eminimum duration: The minimum duration of 45 days will not be a requirement for 2019 to 2020 academic year delivery. Industry placements should be on average 350 hours with a minimum of 315 hours. Whilst a typical working day on a placement is between 7 – 7.5 hours, the total 315 hours can be delivered at the discretion of the provider in accordance with the needs of the employer and the student (for example, if shorter days are required for those with SEND, part time work or other commitments, or to accommodate different industries working patterns)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"industry-specific-placements-only\"\u003eIndustry specific placements only\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConstruction: Students can now complete a Commercial, Charitable or Community Project for a maximum of 105 hours of their placement, working closely with an external employer to develop appropriate technical skills. The rest of the hours should be spent individually with an external employer to ensure the student gains experience of the workplace working independently from peers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConstruction and Engineering \u0026amp; Manufacturing: Students can now spend a maximum of 105 hours of their total hours within an already established Skills Hub or Training Centre: in such a case, students will then need to complete the remainder of their placement with this same employer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDigital: Students studying a Digital course can now undertake a placement that develops their general Digital knowledge and skills as opposed to those only relevant to their specific specialism\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"fund-package\"\u003eEmployer support fund\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e providers within the South West and West Midlands have been invited to take part in this pilot. We have selected providers in these regions to ensure that there is a good mix of types of areas (for example rural, urban and opportunity areas) plus a mix of employer and provider types. Selecting providers in these regions also allows us to maximise the number of industry placements that are in the pilot to give us the most robust findings. This will allow us to look at the difference the funding makes to provision of industry placements depending on industry, employer and area types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot’s findings will enable us to better support all providers delivering T Levels and industry placements through identifying the impact of additional funding on employers’ willingness to offer placements, gathering evidence on employer costs associated with placements and informing our thinking on how to best deploy future funding. Findings from this pilot will be shared with all providers receiving \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e throughout the academic year 2019 to 2020 and a full evaluation is expected to be published in late 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"employer-support-package\"\u003eEmployer support package\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn employer support package will be developed to support employers throughout the 2019 to 2020 academic year. This will be designed to equip employers with the information and understanding needed to build their confidence and effectively plan and implement high quality placements. We will procure an organisation to develop and implement this package of support alongside industry professionals. The package will include both general and industry-specific guidance, face-to-face workshops, webinars and “on-demand” hands-on support. More information will be available at the beginning of the 2019 to 2020 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther information about the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industry-placements-policy-framework\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eupdated policy\u003c/a\u003e and additional support package being developed is set out in more detail is available GOV.UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"purpose\"\u003ePurpose\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this information is to detail the arrangements for delivering industry placements through the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e in 2019 to 2020 academic year for those providers in receipt of an allocation from the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e in 2018 to 2019 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring October 2017, we wrote to providers to advise them about \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e and industry placements (formally known as work placements).  Providers were required to complete an implementation plan to access this funding and the Department assessed these plans to ensure they were complete.  Funding for the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e has been included in allocation statements for 2018 to 2019 academic year, as has the number of funded students and the minimum number of placements to be delivered by the end of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e is to facilitate the build-up of capacity and capability to deliver substantial industry placements and deliver such placements from the 2018 to 2019 academic year. The placements being delivered are for students on vocational and technical study programmes at level 2 and level 3. It is recognised that the delivery of significant numbers of industry placements as part of T Levels is a significant step change for the sector. This is why this funding has been provided now to help build capacity ahead of the roll out of T Levels, from 2020, which industry placements will be a compulsory part of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"changes-from-2018-to-2019-academic-year-to-2019-to-2020-academic-year\"\u003eChanges from 2018 to 2019 academic year to 2019 to 2020 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are changes to the principles and criteria of the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e for 2019 to 2020 academic year as mentioned above. The new models for industry placements gives stability in funding for providers so they can build on their capacity building in 2018 to 2019 academic year and increase the number of students accessing and completing industry placements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 2019 to 2020 academic year if providers arrange industry placements for students studying AGQs that have not been used to calculate the \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e allocation, to help build their capacity in other curriculum areas/industries, this will count towards the 20% delivery target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor 2019 to 2020 academic year we are increasing the proportion of qualifying students for whom we are requiring an industry placement to be provided.  For 2018 to 2019 academic year, this was based on 10% of qualifying students. For 2019 to 2020, this is to increase to 20% of qualifying students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow T Levels are confirmed as level 3 programmes we are also increasing our emphasis on level 3 students. Therefore for delivery in 2019 to 2020 academic year we are introducing a requirement to prioritise level 3 placements. Providers will be required to deliver at least 10 percent  more level 3 placements compared to their baseline split between level 2 and level 3 qualifying students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example - a provider with 1,000 qualifying students, split equally between L2 to L3 (500 students at L2 and 500 at L3):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethey will need to deliver a placement for 20% of their qualifying students, so 200 placements\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethis is a baseline of 100 level 3 students in a placement\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe minimum number of placements for level 3 students would be to increase the 100 by 10%\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003etherefore a minimum of 100 x 1.1 = 110  level 3 placements during 2019 to 2020\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo calculate this we will look at the proportion of qualifying students that were on level 3 study programmes in 2017 to 2018 academic year, apply that proportion to the minimum number of placements required in 2019 to 2020 academic year, increase the level 3 delivery by 10% and then calculate the minimum number of level 3 students we expect to be on a placement in the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db04eca40f0b609d6237b2b/Giving_priority_to_Level_3_Students_for_CDF_Industry_Placements_v2.pdf\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--custom\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db04ecae5274a0913305552/thumbnail_Giving_priority_to_Level_3_Students_for_CDF_Industry_Placements_v2.pdf.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5db04eca40f0b609d6237b2b/Giving_priority_to_Level_3_Students_for_CDF_Industry_Placements_v2.pdf\"\u003eGiving priority to Level 3 Students for CDF Industry Placements examples\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e607 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e3 pages\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"qualifications-that-count-towards-the-20-cdf-target-for-the-2019-to-2020-academic-year\"\u003eQualifications that count towards the 20% \u003cabbr title=\"Capacity and delivery fund\"\u003eCDF\u003c/abbr\u003e target for the 2019 to 2020 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018 to 2019 academic year, students on Applied General Qualifications (\u003cabbr title=\"Applied General Qualifications\"\u003eAGQ\u003c/abbr\u003e) courses that undertook ‘T Level style’ Industry placements funded through the capacity delivery fund, were not counted towards the 10% Industry Placement target as they did not fall within the published definition of a ‘qualifying student’ for the 2018 to 2019 cohort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have had lots of feedback on this issue and we have reviewed the position for 2019 to 2020 academic year.

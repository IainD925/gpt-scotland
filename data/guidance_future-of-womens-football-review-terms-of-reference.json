It stated that ‘There is huge potential for the game to grow further, but to make this a reality there needs to be serious investment in women’s football, in its finances, in its infrastructure, and in the administration of the game’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK government has therefore initiated a Review of the Future of Women’s Football. This review will not focus on elements of the women’s game that are shared with the Fan Led Review, such as club heritage, owners’ and directors’ tests, financial sustainability of clubs and independent regulation, as the outcomes of the Fan Led Review will apply to women’s football in the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"terms-of-reference\"\u003eTerms of Reference\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chair of the Review will be supported in the evidence gathering and analysis by senior officials from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp; Sport (DCMS) and the Football Association.

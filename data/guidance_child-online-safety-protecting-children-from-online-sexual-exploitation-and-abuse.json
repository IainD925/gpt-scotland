The draft Online Safety Bill confers powers on Ofcom to oversee and enforce the new regulatory regime, and requires Ofcom to prepare codes of practice to assist providers in complying with their duties of care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnline platforms can be used by offenders to sexually abuse children or facilitate offline abuse. Online child sexual exploitation and abuse is when offenders use technology or the internet to view and share child sexual abuse material, groom children online, or live stream the sexual abuse of children. This includes abuse perpetrated by other children against any individual under the age of 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChild sexual abuse material is any representation of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities. This could involve penetrative sexual activity or non-penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing or touching outside of clothing. It could also include erotic poses or pictures of a child’s body produced for sexual purposes. Images which appear to be self-generated by the child could be linked to abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-you-should-do-as-a-business\"\u003eWhat you should do as a business\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should \u003cstrong\u003ereport\u003c/strong\u003e all forms of child sexual exploitation or abuse as soon as possible to your \u003cstrong\u003elocal police force\u003c/strong\u003e.

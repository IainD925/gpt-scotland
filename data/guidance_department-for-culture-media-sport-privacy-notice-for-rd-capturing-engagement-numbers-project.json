A data subject is someone who can be recognised, directly or indirectly, by information such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or data relating to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. These types of identifying information are known as ‘personal data’. Data protection law applies to the processing of personal data, including its collection, use and storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-personal-data-do-we-collect\"\u003eWhat personal data do we collect?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe personal information we collect comes from \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://huq.io/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHuq\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.pulsarplatform.com/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePulsar\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.strava.com/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eStrava\u003c/a\u003e and and aerial imagery.

The majority of the data will be anonymised before we receive it and we will have no means, nor interest in, to link it back to individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will also use high-altitude drone footage of crowds attending the Bradford City of Culture events, especially the Les Girafes exhibit. The footage shows around 5,000 people at different locations around Bradford, watching or walking near the Les Girafes exhibit. In addition, drone footage of around 600 people visiting Giant’s Causeway from the Pexels and Envato databases will be used. The Pexels footage is freely available, while the Envato footage is available to anyone with the purchase of a licence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-will-we-use-your-data\"\u003eHow will we use your data?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis data will be used to develop and test a methodology for measuring the public’s engagement with or participation in cultural and sporting events or activities that are unticketed. This will in turn help DCMS to better understand its sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne hypothesis of the research project is that by combining data sets like social media mentions (which will include mentions of events or activities), geolocation data, aerial imagery, and mobile app data with methodologies like textual analysis, it will be possible to develop a methodology for estimating the number of people that are engaged with an event or activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-legal-basis-for-processing-my-data\"\u003eWhat is the legal basis for processing my data?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo process this personal data, our legal reason for collecting or processing this data is: Article 6(1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawful basis that we rely on to process your personal data will determine which of the following rights are available to you. Much of the processing we do in DCMS will be necessary to meet our legal obligations or to perform a public task. If we hold personal data about you in different parts of DCMS for different purposes, then the legal basis we rely on in each case may not be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-will-your-data-be-shared-with\"\u003eWho will your data be shared with?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe data above will be used by the project research team, i.e. named suppliers at Verian, Faculty, and the University of Glasgow. It will not be shared outside named individuals within these companies and will not be shared with DCMS. Any data shared with DCMS will be anonymised before being sent. Conclusions and findings of the research will also be shared with DCMS, but these will not contain any of your personal data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-long-will-my-data-be-held-for\"\u003eHow long will my data be held for?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe research project is due to complete on 31 March 2025. Although it is in the interests of both DCMS and the suppliers to complete on time, as with all research, the project may run over. Delays are not anticipated to be any longer than six months in the worst case scenario. This data will be deleted after the research project completes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"will-my-data-be-used-for-automated-decision-making-or-profiling\"\u003eWill my data be used for automated decision making or profiling?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will not use your data for any automated decision making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"will-my-data-be-transferred-outside-the-uk-and-if-it-is-how-will-it-be-protected\"\u003eWill my data be transferred outside the UK and if it is how will it be protected?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will not send your data beyond the European Economic Area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-are-your-data-protection-rights\"\u003eWhat are your data protection rights?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou have rights over your personal data under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018).

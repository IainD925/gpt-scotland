It will be most helpful to those of you who are not travelling with or to join a parent or legal guardian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe understand that your decision to leave your home will have been difficult, and that you may be anxious about living in a new country. This guide is a starting point; it gives you the information you need about arriving and living in the UK, including where you can go for help if you have any problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"before-you-arrive-in-the-uk\"\u003eBefore you arrive in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you come to the UK your parent(s) or legal guardian will need to provide parental consent documents including a form for the local council in England (the local government authority where your sponsor lives) with information about your living arrangements when you get here. This will include information about who will be responsible for looking after you. This will either be an adult relative or your sponsor (usually a friend of your parents). Before you travel, someone from the local council should contact you and your family to talk to you about what to expect. Your sponsor will also be able to help you with any questions or concerns you may have, and they should support you as you settle into life in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also a good idea to arrange a video call with your sponsor before you arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"travel-arrangements\"\u003eTravel arrangements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you travel, you and your parent(s) or legal guardian will make a travel plan with your sponsor. It is important that you have a copy of this travel plan. Wherever possible, you should travel with your sponsor or a family member, and by aeroplane. If your sponsor cannot travel with you, you will need to know where they are waiting for you and how to contact them. During your journey, you should stay in touch with your parents and sponsor (if they cannot go with you) and keep them updated if there are any delays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need any help on the journey, you can contact any airline staff member or other member of staff at the airport. On arrival in the UK, Border Officials at the desk where you show your passport will ensure you have proper arrangements in place to travel to your sponsor’s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-you-should-know-in-your-first-few-days-on-arrival\"\u003eWhat you should know in your first few days on arrival\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after you arrive at your sponsor’s home (usually within 24 hours), you will be visited by someone from the local council where you and your sponsor live. This is nothing to worry about. Councils have a duty to help protect children and they will visit you and your sponsor regularly to support you both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first meeting you can expect them to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echeck that you are happy with your new living arrangements and are receiving the immediate support you need;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003espeak to you, any relative who has come with you, and your sponsor separately as well as together; and;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake sure you know how to raise any concerns you have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour sponsor will understand that moving to a new country without your parents is not easy and that you might feel anxious and unsettled to start with. It’s a good idea to talk to your sponsor, and any relatives that might be with you, about how you are feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring your first few days and weeks your sponsor should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eshow you around your local area\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehelp you to stay in touch with friends and family over the phone and online\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eensure you have all the essentials you need - like toiletries and clothes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehelp you create a UKVI account to enable you to use our online services to prove your rights and keep your information (including travel documents) up to date\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003earrange for you to go to school or college\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eregister you with a doctor and help you find a dentist\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eregister you with the Embassy of Ukraine to the UK\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also important to take some time to settle into your new home following your journey and get to know your sponsor. You should also contact your family to let them know you have arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you arrive at your sponsor’s home in England, you might find that there are some differences compared to your life back in Ukraine. In England you are not legally considered an adult until you turn 18 and so your sponsor may not allow you to have the same freedom and independence as you did in Ukraine, for example, they might ask that you do not stay out too late at night. You should discuss arrangements with your sponsor so that you are clear on what their expectations are. Try to be respectful of their rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also be aware that England has some different laws to Ukraine, and it is a good idea to speak to your sponsor about these differences. This is important so that you don’t unwittingly break any rules and get into trouble. For example, it is illegal for under 18-year-olds to purchase and consume alcohol and tobacco products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-welfare\"\u003eYour welfare\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEither your sponsor or an adult relative will be responsible for looking after you.

Most young people continue until the end of the academic year in which they turn 18. Until you turn 19 years old, education in the UK is completely free, and therefore offers you a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills and develop your knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour sponsor will arrange for you to go to school or college unless your parents and sponsor decide for you to be educated at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour teachers at school or college will understand English is not your first language and they will make sure you get the help you need in order to get the most out of your lessons and achieve your potential.

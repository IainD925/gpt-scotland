This includes building work to an existing building which will make it a higher-risk building (for example adding storeys) or for a building undergoing a change of use. Higher-risk buildings are subject to the requirements of the new higher-risk regime directly overseen by the Building Safety Regulator (the Regulator).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHigher-risk buildings during building work in an existing building are defined in Section 120D of the Building Act 1984 (the 1984 Act) as amended by the Building Safety Act 2022 (the 2022 Act) and Higher-Risk Buildings (Descriptions and Supplementary Provisions) Regulations 2023 (the Regulations).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand whether an existing building during building work is a higher-risk building, the 1984 Act as amended by the 2022 Act, and the Regulations need to be considered together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring building work in an existing building, higher-risk buildings are defined as buildings with at least two residential units, care homes, and hospitals which are at least 18 metres in height or have at least 7 storeys. This definition does not amend definitions of higher-risk buildings in other legislation - for example, the definition for higher-risk buildings in occupation (section 65 of the 2022 Act), which can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/criteria-for-being-a-higher-risk-building-during-the-occupation-phase-of-the-new-higher-risk-regime\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCriteria for being a higher-risk building during the occupation phase of the new higher-risk regime\u003c/a\u003e.

It is a tool to help potential dutyholders (i.e., the client, designer, principal designer, contractor, and principal contractor) and accountable persons determine if their building is a higher-risk building. This guidance should be used over other guidance covering buildings, height measurements and/or storey measurements to determine whether the definition of higher-risk building set out is law applies to your building. This guidance and the specific circumstances of your building need to be considered by you when discharging your duties under building regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to becoming a higher-risk building under the Act and the Regulations, your building may also be subject to other legislation and statutory duties, such as the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. You will need to work with the relevant dutyholders in the building to ensure it is safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagrams in this guidance document show examples of potential buildings and are for illustrative purposes only.

For example, if a building contains a shopping centre but also has two or more residential units, then it is a higher-risk building, provided it meets the height or storeys threshold. Buildings which are boarding accommodation in schools and university accommodation would also be considered higher-risk buildings, provided they meet the height or storeys threshold for a higher-risk building, as they contain residential units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuildings that contain supported and sheltered accommodation are considered higher-risk buildings if they meet the height or storeys threshold, as they contain residential units.

For example, if a gallery floor, forming the third storey of a building, has an internal floor area half the area or more of the largest other storey, then this gallery floor should be counted as a separate storey. If the gallery floor is smaller than half the area of the largest storey, then it should not be counted as a separate storey. An example of how gallery floors should be counted is given in Diagram 13.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/652e507f6b6fbf0014b757ce/Picture13.svg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagram 13 shows one 7-storey residential tower with a gallery floor that has a floor area over 50% of the storey above it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example, the gallery floor’s internal floor area is greater than 50% of the internal floor area of the storeys above it.

It means a doorway, archway or similar opening. Access which is only used in an emergency or for maintenance is not included. For example, a doorway between two buildings used regularly by residents counts as access, while an emergency exit between two buildings does not. If an exit is used both as an emergency exit and for regular access (for example, a front entrance used for both purposes), it counts as access. Under the Regulations the definition of access is limited to the doorway or opening, it does not include corridors, walkways or atriums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cstrong\u003eaccountable person\u003c/strong\u003e is the dutyholder during a higher-risk building’s occupation and must meet the statutory duties as set out in Part 4 of the Act. If an occupied higher-risk building has just one accountable person, they will automatically become the \u003cstrong\u003eprincipal accountable person\u003c/strong\u003e for that building. Where there are two or more accountable persons, the one responsible for the repair of the structure and exterior of the building will be the \u003cstrong\u003eprincipal accountable person\u003c/strong\u003e in line with the statutory definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Building Safety Act 2022\u003c/strong\u003e (the \u003cstrong\u003eAct\u003c/strong\u003e) was granted Royal Assent on 28 April 2022. It implements the recommendations made in Dame Judith Hackitt’s report Building a Safer Future to create a new robust regulatory system for higher-risk buildings. Her recommendations set out clear duties and responsibilities for those who commission, design, construct and refurbish higher-risk buildings, and those who are responsible for making sure that buildings are safely managed when occupied.

For part of a building to be a separate ‘section’, it should have its own egress out of the building.   For example, commercial areas such as cafes and bars on the roof of or within towers should not be considered a separate section for the purpose of regulation 4(6)(b) if they share an exit with the residential floors below (despite having a different use).  When assessing whether part of a building can be considered a separate section, it may also be relevant to consider what that part is used for.  If an area of the building is used for a different purpose to another area, it is more likely to be considered its own section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStructure\u003c/strong\u003e is defined in Regulation 1(3) of the Higher-Risk Buildings (Descriptions and Supplementary Provisions) Regulations 2023 as a roofed construction with walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

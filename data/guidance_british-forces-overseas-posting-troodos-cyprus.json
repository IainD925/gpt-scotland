The station was formed in 1878 when Cyprus was ceded to Britain by the Ottoman Empire to counter Russian expansion into the Near East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first soldiers to arrive in Cyprus came from the Egyptian campaign and were initially billeted at Polemidhia just north of Limassol. They were exhausted and ravaged by disease in Egypt where a number of them had already succumbed to typhoid. In those days, malaria was endemic on the island and the summer heat unbearable. It was therefore decided to establish a hill station in the Troodos mountains and provide a field hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe British Army and British government officials that ruled the island moved to Troodos in the summer months to take advantage of the cooler and healthier conditions of the mountains. The journey from Polemidhia took two days using mules and by foot. A night stop was made in the village of Perapedhi. They used the military roads that were surveyed by Captain Kitchener (later Lord Kitchener) and built by Royal Engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGolf Section is a communications detachment of the Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus) (\u003cabbr title=\"Joint Service Signal Unit\"\u003eJSSU\u003c/abbr\u003e (Cyp). Geographically remote, the detachment is located on Troodos Station within the Troodos mountains 100 miles from Ayios Nikolaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"accommodation-and-leisure-facilities\"\u003eAccommodation and leisure facilities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor details of married quarters see the separate \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/british-forces-overseas-posting-episkopi-cyprus\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEpiskopi guide\u003c/a\u003e on this site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"medical-facilities\"\u003eMedical facilities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe medical centre is situated at British Forces Episkopi, approximately half way between the majority of married quarters and working locations. It has a team of full time doctors, practice nurses, administrative / paramedical staff, a community psychiatric nurse, SSAFA midwifery and social worker facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to providing a full range of all the primary health care facilities you would expect from a civilian medical practice in the UK, an emergency ambulance service and minor casualty reception facility is operated 24 hours a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"secondary-medical-care\"\u003eSecondary medical care\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecondary medical care is provided at The Princess Mary’s Hospital (TPMH) at RAF Akrotiri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"education\"\u003eEducation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTroodos children are educated at Episkopi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"amenities\"\u003eAmenities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe station itself has few facilities; there is a small shop, which sells the bare essentials such as bread and milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe small village of Platres, which is about 8 kilometres away, has various markets that sell other essentials. The station has a small gym equipped with a running machine, a rowing machine and weight training facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mess itself hosts a small bar, television room with Sky TV and pool table. It is open to all mess members and personnel who are posted to the section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also a squash court and a tennis court on the station. During the winter months, the station’s NEFSKI ski store is extensively used, making use of the ski runs on Mount Olympus. Snow boards and skiing equipment can be hired at a reduced rate. Harsh weather conditions are experienced during the winter period; consequently 4x4 vehicles are essential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

In some cases, we use estimated pupil numbers if the academy’s funding agreement includes a clause to this effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe funding agreement clause may be conditional, and an academy’s allocation is funded on estimates until certain conditions are met. This is usually until all year groups are present. Once these conditions are met, the autumn census becomes the basis for future funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial and alternative provision academies are not funded on estimates as the number of high needs places forms the basis of their general annual grant. More information on how high needs places are funded is available in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2024-to-2025\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehigh needs funding arrangements: 2024 to 2025\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease refer to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-allocations#academy-funding-in-2023-to-2024-an-overview-of-funding-for-the-current-academic-year\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘academies revenue funding allocations’\u003c/a\u003e for more information on how your allocation is calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"estimating-pupil-numbers-data-collection\"\u003eEstimating pupil numbers data collection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions provide their estimated pupil numbers in October each year, using an online form via the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDepartment for Education sign in\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have now published information on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/estimating-pupil-numbers-epn-how-to-complete-your-return-for-2025-to-2026\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehow to complete the estimating pupil numbers data collection\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce agreed, estimated pupil numbers are used to calculate the academy’s budget. We review them to ensure they are reasonable, and that evidence supports any significant changes in numbers. However, where an increase in pupils relates to basic need, this is funded by the local authority and should not be reflected in the estimates an institution provides to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an academy does not provide their estimated pupil numbers, we will use the most recent census data to calculate their funding. If they are a growing school that is still adding year groups, this can result in a funding shortfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pupil-number-adjustment-pna\"\u003ePupil number adjustment (\u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere we initially fund academies based on estimated pupil numbers, we include them in the annual \u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e exercise during the academic year. The \u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e exercise determines if adjustments are required to bring initial funding allocations into line with the actual pupil numbers that schools record in the autumn (October) school census.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome estimate-funded academies have funding agreements with a \u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e threshold, where no adjustment will occur if actual pupil numbers vary by more or less than a specified percentage. If an academy’s estimate of pupil numbers is outside the threshold, or no threshold applies, we adjust funding through the \u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e process. This results in either an increase or decrease in funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe use an academy’s estimated pupil numbers, and the pupil led funding they receive to produce per-pupil funding rates for the academic year. This average figure will be adjusted downwards for academies delivering T Levels within 16 to 19 provision to exclude the relevant T Level funding. We multiply the difference in actual pupil numbers by the per-pupil rates, taking account of any threshold, to determine the required adjustment. As in previous years, we run the calculation separately for pre-16 school budget share and 16 to 19 funding, and then combine the results into a single overall adjustment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere local authorities have already funded growth in pre-16 pupil numbers to meet basic need, we will deduct the amount they have paid from any positive \u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e to ensure that academies are only funded for the growth once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pna-calculator-for-2024-to-2025\"\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e calculator for 2024 to 2025\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use our \u003cabbr title=\"pupil number adjustment\"\u003ePNA\u003c/abbr\u003e calculator with the figures you have for your academy to estimate your own adjustment.

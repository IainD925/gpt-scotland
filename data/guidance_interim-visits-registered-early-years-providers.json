We want to allow providers time to get back to normal following the period of uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Until 25 September 2020, providers should use ‘reasonable endeavours’ to meet the requirements of section 1 of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/early-years-foundation-stage\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eearly years foundation stage (\u003cabbr title=\"early years foundation stage\"\u003eEYFS\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/a\u003e.

After 25 September 2020, providers must meet the learning and development requirements in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe would usually re-inspect a provider with an inadequate or requires improvement grade within 6 or 12 months respectively and look at learning and development requirements through an inspection under the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eeducation inspection framework\u003c/a\u003e.

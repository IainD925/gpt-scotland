Scope of the practice direction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rules provide the framework for the management of proceedings brought before the Tribunal. Certain of the Rules are prescriptive in nature, such as the requirements as to fees and forms. However, the adjudicator has a wide discretion to manage proceedings as he/she sees fit. For the sake of clarity and consistency and so that parties know what to expect, this direction sets out the Tribunal’s practice in relation to the main areas where the adjudicator’s discretion operates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis practice direction will not fetter the discretion of the adjudicator.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"setting-the-period-for-filing-a-defence\"\u003e2. Setting the period for filing a defence\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rules do not specify time periods for actions to be completed; time periods are set by the adjudicator. The normal period of time (under rule 3(3)) for the primary respondent to file a defence under rule 3(4) will be two months. However, in setting the period for the filing of a defence, the adjudicator will consider whether there are any factors, such as an indication in the application of the results of any pre-action enquiries or contact between the parties, which may mean that a different period of time will be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"joining-of-co-respondents-to-proceedings\"\u003e3.

It is necessary for the applicant to request that a party(ies) is joined to a case and the adjudicator will consider the merits of the request. When the application is formally sent to the primary respondent, the Tribunal will notify the applicant and primary respondent of the date by which such a request should be made, if it has not been made with the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.1.2\u003c/strong\u003e The first requirement of an applicant in requesting the joining of a member or director of a company is to furnish evidence that the party named does indeed have this status; a matter that can be shown e.g. by the filing of copies of documents from Companies House. The applicant should also give reasons as to why it wants another party(ies) joined to the proceedings. Having received a request supported by evidence of the relevant status of the party and reasons for the request, the adjudicator will write to the proposed co-respondent(s) asking for their comments on the request. It would be a denial of natural justice not to allow the potential co-respondent(s) to comment upon the request. The adjudicator will then give a preliminary view on the matter, allowing the parties the opportunity to request a hearing as per rule 5(3) before the preliminary view becomes a final decision. The preliminary view will include a brief statement as to the reasons that have given rise to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.1.3\u003c/strong\u003e If a party is joined to the proceedings the applicant will have to copy all documentation that it has filed in relation to the application to the co-respondent(s) within 14 days of the notification of the joining. Any further correspondence and evidence must also be copied to the co-respondent(s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.1.4\u003c/strong\u003e In relation to costs the adjudicator will give careful consideration to the facts of the case as to whether a co-respondent(s) should be jointly and severally liable for costs, especially where no defence has been filed (under rules 3(2), (3), (4) and (5) only the primary respondent can file a defence). The adjudicator will take into account, for example, whether it is established that the co-respondent is the controlling mind of the respondent company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.1.5\u003c/strong\u003e Applications in relation to limited liability partnerships (LLPs) can be made to the adjudicator. In the case of LLPs, co-respondents will be members and/or designated members (as per the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000). The same criteria in considering requests to join co-respondents will apply to LLPs as apply to companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"evidence\"\u003e4. Evidence\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.1\u003c/strong\u003e The purpose of evidence before the tribunal is for parties to prove their case by demonstrating facts and rebuttal of the other side’s version of events. In relation to the applicant, it is a statutory requirement under section 69(1)(a) and (b) that it establishes goodwill or reputation (section 69(7)). Unless the nature and extent of the applicant’s goodwill or reputation are particularised in the claim and admitted by the respondent, evidence filed by the applicant must, therefore, include proof that the applicant has the requisite goodwill or reputation to bring the action before the tribunal, in addition to other facts which it considers relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.1.2\u003c/strong\u003e To assist the tribunal in coming to a decision, the respondent’s evidence should show not only facts in relation to the allegations which the applicant has made but should include facts about its own activities, such as the nature, history and longevity of its business activities, with specific reference to the contested company name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"time-periods-for-filing-evidence\"\u003e4.2 Time periods for filing evidence\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.2.1\u003c/strong\u003e Under rule 4 periods of two months will be set for the filing of evidence. Normally the applicant will file evidence first, the respondent(s) will be given an opportunity to file evidence in answer, and the applicant will be permitted to file evidence in reply. However, the adjudicator will consider the statement of grounds and counterstatement and, having regard to the issues in dispute, may decide that the respondent(s) should file evidence first, or that the evidence should be filed concurrently by the parties. Similarly, under rule 6(3), the adjudicator may control the evidence by giving directions; for example, as to the issues on which he/she requires evidence; the nature of the evidence, and the manner in which the evidence is to be filed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.2.2\u003c/strong\u003e The adjudicator may allow the filing of additional evidence; he/she will decide upon the time to be allowed after considering the nature of the evidence which is to be filed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"without-prejudice-material\"\u003e4.3 “Without prejudice” material\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.3.1 Correspondence between the parties in disputes about a company name have been included with statements of case and in evidence. In some circumstances this correspondence is clearly “without prejudice”. It is possible that the best evidence that the registration of a company name was opportunistic within the terms of the Act will arise from correspondence between the parties. This may give rise to a tension between the desire of a party to put forward its best case and the “without prejudice” rule. However, the “without prejudice” rule must still have effect upon proceedings before the tribunal. There is no opt-out from the fundamental principles of the “without prejudice” rule. However, the holder’s motives in registering the challenged company name will only become material if the owner of the company name presents a prima facie justification for its registration, as per section 69 (4) of the Act, the applicant having established the requisite goodwill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.3.2\u003c/strong\u003e Where the parties have legal representation it will be for the legal representatives to submit that documents should be excluded as being “without prejudice”; the adjudicator will not act of his or her own motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.3.3\u003c/strong\u003e If an application is defended and one or both parties does not have legal representation, an adjudicator will consider whether material should be excluded from the proceedings on the basis that it falls within the “without prejudice” rule, when and where the adjudicator considers that the matter becomes material to the proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.3.4\u003c/strong\u003e The parties will be advised of the adjudicator’s view of the matter. They will be able to contest the findings of the adjudicator in correspondence and, if a party continues to contest the decision of the adjudicator, it will be able to request an interlocutory hearing to make its submissions. If an adjudicator has considered matter that it is decided is “without prejudice” and for which privilege has not been waived, the adjudicator will recuse (disqualify) himself/herself from making the substantive decision. The adjudicator(s) making the decision will not be tainted by having seen “without prejudice” material. Further, references to and comments on “without prejudice” material will also be liable to be excluded from the proceedings, depending upon the nature of the references and the comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.3.5\u003c/strong\u003e The normal criteria for considering whether matter is “without prejudice” will be taken into account.

Although you currently have burger-king.co.uk this would not be the most obvious first choice for any individual to use, should they be speculatively looking for your U.K. website.\nA rather similar although less explicit and less exorbitant attempt has been made by Mr Conway to sell the domain name \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ebt.org\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, one of those in dispute in the present actions, to British Telecom for £4,700.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the above case the correspondence of the respondents offering the sale of the domain names to the plaintiffs was not shut out as being “without prejudice” because it was not considered to be part of genuine negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.3.8\u003c/strong\u003e If there have been several exchanges of correspondence between the parties over a potential transfer of the company name for consideration, it is very likely that this correspondence will be excluded from proceedings as being “without prejudice” as being indicative of genuine negotiation.

A request for an extension of a time period must be made on Form CNA 5 (rule 7(4)), accompanied by the fee.

Therefore, the Tribunal expects that requests for extensions to periods of time will be the exception, rather than the norm. A request for an extension of time will not be granted automatically but will be subject to the adjudicator’s discretion. The adjudicator will have regard to the reasons supplied, the length of time requested, the fairness and proportionality of the request, including the complexity of the case, and any prejudice likely to be suffered by either party in allowing or refusing the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.1.4\u003c/strong\u003e In requesting any extension, parties should show that the facts merit the request (rule 7(4)). In particular, the request should show clearly what progress has been made thus far, what still needs to be done and the reasons why the party making the request has been unable to complete the particular action required (e.g. gathering of evidence). If the request is made after the time period has expired (a retrospective extension request), it should also state why the request is being made out of time (rule 7(4)).

The adjudicator expects that all other correspondence, including requests for extensions to time periods, will also be copied to other parties in the proceedings, except where confidentiality has specifically been requested under rule 6(2)(d). If parties fail to observe this stated practice of copying correspondence, the adjudicator will invoke rule 6(2)(a); it is therefore in the interests of all parties, to reduce both costs and time, that correspondence is copied to the other parties at the same time that it is sent to the Tribunal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"applications-to-strike-off\"\u003e8.

It should be noted, however, that the adjudicator will not normally award costs to the applicant if the respondent, whilst not defending the application, nevertheless satisfies the tribunal that it did not receive any notice, or did not receive adequate notice, that the application would be made. The adjudicator will, likewise, normally not award costs if the applicant indicates in box 7 of the application form (CNA1) that it did not contact the company prior to making the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.4.2\u003c/strong\u003e If there is no indication (or there is inadequate indication) on the application form as to whether reasonable pre-action contact was made, the adjudicator may request information from the applicant prior to considering whether an award of costs is appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"off-scale-costs\"\u003e10.5 Off-scale costs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.5.1\u003c/strong\u003e There are exceptions to the practice of awarding costs from the scale, such as unreasonable behaviour. In particular, it should be noted that the adjudicator expects that a prospective applicant will have sent the respondent a letter before action and properly considered any response prior to filing an application to the tribunal. If an application is unsuccessful because the respondent shows a valid defence under section 69(4) of the Act (such as that it is conducting a legitimate business under the company name) which should have been obvious to the applicant if reasonable pre-action enquiries had been made, the adjudicator will be willing to consider a request from the respondent for an award of costs above the usual scale. Such an award would be made in order to compensate the respondent for the unreasonable behaviour of the applicant; that is, by making an unrealistic application which the respondent has been put to the burden of defending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.5.2\u003c/strong\u003e If it becomes apparent that a particular party is persistently causing successful applications to be made to the tribunal, the adjudicator will be willing to consider requests for an award of costs off the scale to the applicant(s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.5.3\u003c/strong\u003e The adjudicator may award costs off the scale, approaching full compensation, to deal proportionately with wide breaches of rules, delaying tactics or other unreasonable behaviour. Any claim for costs approaching full compensation will need to be supported by a bill itemising the actual costs incurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.5.4\u003c/strong\u003e The adjudicator may award costs below the minimum indicated by the standard scale.

If the normal scale is applied, there will be no uplift to take account of any CFA. Even when off-scale costs are awarded, the amount will be assessed using the usual principles for assessing off-scale costs, and the amount will not be affected by the existence of a CFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.6.2\u003c/strong\u003e Consequently, the requirement in rule 44.15 of the Civil Procedure Rules to provide information about any CFA does not apply to proceedings before the adjudicator.

They may also be veterinary or human medicines under development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, products investigated in a clinical trial may fall under the definition of a veterinary medicine based solely on the reason why they might be prescribed by a veterinary surgeon in relation to the clinical condition being investigated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"atcs-in-the-uk\"\u003eATCs in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn ATC is normally required if the design of a clinical trial in any way prevents participating vets from using their full professional judgement during clinical decision‑making concerning the prescription of veterinary medicines. This may occur if animals are randomised, or vets are blinded, to treatment groups or when the medicines used during a clinical trial will not be labelled in accordance with the VMR, as might be necessary to facilitate ‘blinding’ of study participants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this context, even if the same veterinary medicine is used in each study group, but aspects of its administration during a clinical trial are randomised between groups and/or blinded, an ATC is normally required. For example, the study protocol may dictate randomisation/blinding of the route of administration, the administration technique, and/or the dosage regimen; dose, frequency of administration, and duration of treatment course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn ATC permits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe use of a medicine during a clinical trial, including the use of a medicine outside the terms of its marketing authorisation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe procurement and supply of that medicine\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe import of any medicine specified in the certificate in accordance with the conditions of that certificate\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe produce from treated animals to enter the food chain, if appropriate\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe use of randomisation and/or blinding within the study protocol\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe administration of a placebo product, where specified\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three different types of application that can be used to obtain an ATC; type‑A, type‑B, and type‑S.

For example, an ATC is not required for a clinical trial of a purely surgical intervention, where no aspect of the administration of a veterinary medicine is under investigation. Additionally, an ATC is not required for a clinical trial investigating an animal feed additive, such as a nutritional supplement, provided the feed additive(s) to be tested does not fall within the definition of a veterinary medicine, when used in accordance with the study protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe retrospective analysis of clinical observations is not a clinical trial, and therefore does not require an ATC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on the study design, a clinical trial carried out by a vet who will administer a veterinary medicine in accordance with the provisions of the prescribing ‘cascade’, or a clinical trial involving a veterinary medicine used fully in accordance with its Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) may not require an ATC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find more information on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-cascade-prescribing-unauthorised-medicines\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe Cascade: Prescribing unauthorised medicines\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudies licensed in full by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA), including laboratory studies, do not require an ATC if they are conducted in non-food animals or animals, including their products, declared never to enter the food chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, for those studies in food‑producing animals that have been licensed in full under the ASPA, an ATC is not required provided the veterinary medicine to be used has a marketing authorisation (MA) in GB, NI, or the EEA and is to be administered in accordance with this MA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the authorised dosing regimen for the species and route of administration must be used, or a lower dose, and the withdrawal periods set out in the SPC must be observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor Home Office licensed studies conducted in food-producing animals where these criteria are not met, then a type-B ATC application should be submitted to determine or justify an appropriate withdrawal period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther information on how the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/research-and-testing-using-animals\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHome Office regulates the use of animals in research\u003c/a\u003e can be obtained from the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate and associated online guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContact us at \u003ca href=\"mailto:postmaster@vmd.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epostmaster@vmd.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e if you are still unsure whether your proposed study design requires an ATC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-atc-application\"\u003eTypes of ATC application\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"commercial-clinical-trials\"\u003eCommercial clinical trials\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommercial clinical trials are usually conducted by the pharmaceutical industry to generate the confirmatory data required to support a marketing authorisation (MA) application.

They also ensure they attend drug or alcohol treatment and gain access to help with accommodation and education - reducing the risk of further offending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service-workforce-quarterly-march-2022\"\u003eFigures released\u003c/a\u003e today (19 May 2022) show that in the financial year 2021/22, 1,518 people enrolled on the Probation Service’s trainee probation officer scheme, and nearly 1 in 6 were from an ethnic minority background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProbation Minister, Kit Malthouse said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eMaking the streets safer is one of our top priorities so we are giving the Probation Service the resources they need to hold offenders to account, cut crime and reduce the number of victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eProbation officers play an invaluable role in protecting the public and so we are boosting their numbers – meaning there are more people keeping a watchful eye on offenders and ensuring they reform their criminal ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe staffing boost is increasing the amount of face-to-face time that staff have with offenders so they can better protect the community and support rehabilitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMark Feasey is based with the Yorkshire and the Humber regional Probation Service and made the switch from pub landlord via the trainee probation officer route. He said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eIt’s a great career. I get to work with people to help them change their lives and when I’m able to support someone to do that, the rewards are huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe are all human; we can all make mistakes and we’ve all got potential. Helping people break that cycle of offending drives me every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government is also tagging even more offenders as part of its drive to cut crime. Since alcohol tags were launched a year ago as part of government plans to curb drink-fuelled crime, 3,121 offenders have been monitored, with more than 3,000 staying sober. By 2025 around 12,000 offenders will have had their drinking monitored by sobriety tags – part of a £183 million expansion of electronic monitoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as alcohol tags, GPS monitoring equipment has been rolled out across half of England and Wales. Burglars, robbers and thieves who have served a prison sentence of a year or more are tagged on release and tracked, so if they reoffend police can quickly catch them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHer Majesty’s Prison \u0026amp; Probation Service (HMPPS) is currently hiring trainee probation officers across England and Wales.

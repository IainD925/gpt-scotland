These monitoring visits will normally result in a progress judgement against each theme covered, and a brief published report, as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehandbook\u003c/a\u003e.

Concerns arising from monitoring visits may lead to an early full inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe may also carry out a safeguarding follow-up monitoring visit if we have judged a new provider to be making insufficient progress for the safeguarding theme at its previous \u003cabbr title=\"new provider monitoring visit\"\u003eNPMV\u003c/abbr\u003e and it would have been due a follow-up safeguarding visit up to or during the interim phase. This would only occur when the new provider would not be due its full inspection up to and during the interim phase (if it is due, then it will receive a full \u003cabbr title=\"new provider monitoring visit\"\u003eNPMV\u003c/abbr\u003e). The safeguarding follow-up monitoring visit will only cover the safeguarding theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"privacy-notice\"\u003ePrivacy notice\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a visit, inspectors may collect information about staff and learners by talking to them and by looking at documents and other recorded information.

They can help to stop gaps in your National Insurance record. You will get a Class 3 National Insurance credit for each week or part week you provided care for the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one credit available for each Child Benefit claim, no matter how many children are on the claim itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if 2 grandparents provided care for their daughter’s 2 children, there is only one credit available for transfer. The Child Benefit recipient must decide who should have the credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the grandparents provided care for their daughter’s child and their son’s child, there are likely to be 2 Child Benefit recipients. This means 2 credits are available for transfer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf no one has claimed Child Benefit for the child, there is no attached National Insurance credit to transfer.

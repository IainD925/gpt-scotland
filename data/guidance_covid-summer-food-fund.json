That is why we are launching a Covid Summer Food Fund which will enable children who are eligible for benefits-related free school meals to be supported over the summer holiday period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe payments for the Covid Summer Food Fund will be met centrally by DfE.

If a school’s orders are higher than expected, we may speak to the school about why this has occurred and will take forward any necessary action to rectify the position.

If your school’s summer holiday lasts 7 full weeks (rather than 6), you can increase the voucher amount per child from £90 to £105.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"deadline-for-ordering\"\u003eDeadline for ordering\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must order the voucher at least one week before your school term ends, and it will be issued to the family within 7 days unless you have specified a distribution date further in the future. For example, schools closing on 17 July must place orders for all vouchers by 10 July.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you choose a future distribution date, this must be before the end of the school term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese dates are in place in recognition that schools operate to different term times and that school offices will be closed in the summer holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn exceptional circumstances, you may decide to schedule a number of smaller vouchers to be sent to a family instead of a single £90 voucher. The total combined value of these vouchers cannot exceed £90 per eligible child. These vouchers must also be ordered at least one week before your school term ends. The first of these vouchers must be issued to families before the end of the school term, and the final voucher must be issued to families by 14 August.

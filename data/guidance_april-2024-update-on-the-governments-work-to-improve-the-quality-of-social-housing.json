These inspections are now underway. As part of the new regime the Regulator will proactively make sure that registered providers are meeting the revised consumer standards, which were published by the Regulator on 29 February 2024. Landlords who do not abide by these new rules may face a range of sanctions, including appointing new management or unlimited fines. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"quality-of-service\"\u003eQuality of service \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"competence-and-conduct-standard-for-social-landlords\"\u003eCompetence and conduct standard for social landlords  \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will be introducing a new regulatory standard relating to the competence and conduct of staff in the social housing sector. This standard will require social landlords to ensure their staff have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience and  demonstrate the right behaviours to deliver a good service to tenants. It will also require senior managers and executives working in the social housing sector to acquire required qualifications in housing management.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur recent consultation which sets out further detail on our proposals for this new standard has now closed. We are now carefully analysing responses before we direct the Regulator of Social Housing later this year to set the standard.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-sure-tenants-voices-are-heard\"\u003eMaking sure tenants’ voices are heard    \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"four-million-homes\"\u003eFour Million Homes \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fourmillionhomes.org/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFour Million Homes\u003c/a\u003e programme provides free information, guidance, and training on residents’ rights. It will run until March 2025. It helps residents know their rights and to work with their landlords to make sure homes and neighbourhoods are well-maintained, clean, and safe.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn April, we have run training sessions on social housing regulatory requirements, particularly focusing on the new consumer standards. We have also updated the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fourmillionhomes.org/guidance-for-social-housing-residents/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance sections on our website\u003c/a\u003e to reflect these changes and provide residents with the most up-to-date information on their rights. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn May, we are hosting two webinars. The first will be on 13 May and will feature a representative from the Regulator of Social Housing talking about the new standards, their approach to enforce  these rules, and answering questions. The second will be on 15 May and will focus on service charges. We’re also going to be starting our Year 2 programme of training, which will run in person and online. You can find out more and book your space for any of these events at \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fourmillionhomes.org/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFour Million Homes\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-resident-panel\"\u003eThe Resident Panel \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 20 April we held a feedback session with the Resident Panel exploring on how what residents told us recent discussions on neighbourhood management and effective, respectful communications has been shaping our policy thinking.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Panel also told us their priorities for the coming 12 months. This included how the social housing quality programme reforms are being implemented in practice; how residents’ voices are being heard at the national and local level, and their experiences of contractors carrying out repairs \u0026amp; maintenance and other services on behalf of landlords.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResident Panel members will be taking part in focus groups in May to discuss their experiences of having their voices heard by their landlords and of getting involved in their decision-making and governance.     \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"housing-ombudsman\"\u003eHousing Ombudsman  \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Housing Ombudsman Service’s Complaint Handling Code became statutory on 1 April 2024, meaning that social landlords are obliged by law to follow its requirements. The Code aims to achieve best practice in complaint handling and ultimately to provide a better service to social housing residents.

You can see the first report: \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/2024/04/09/ombudsman-highlights-failings-from-8-landlords/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOmbudsman highlights failings from 8 landlords in new approach to sharing learning from severe maladministration\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 25 April, the Housing Ombudsman used their new power from the Social Housing (Regulation) Act 2023 to order Orbit Group to review their damp and mould policy.

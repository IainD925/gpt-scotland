They are used to determine the proportion of students in each funding band which, determines the national funding rate per student. Errors in recording planned hours are likely to have an impact on an institution’s funding allocation. Institutions must record accurate planned hours so that their funding is calculated correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"planned-hours-funded-by-the-esfa\"\u003ePlanned hours funded by the ESFA\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe activities in each student’s study programme in an academic year constitute the planned hours.\nEach student’s planned hours are agreed between the institution and the student at the start of their study programme. You must record accurately all the qualification planned hours and the non-qualification planned hours. This data is used to calculate future funding allocations so it must accurately reflect the learning activities being taken by each student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo count for funding purposes, the planned hours must be timetabled, organised and/or supervised by the institution, and take place in line with the institution’s normal working pattern.

All the hours in both categories need to be recorded accurately on the ILR or school census to avoid problems with future allocations. Both categories are added up to form the total hours of a study programme, and the total hours are used to calculate the funding allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"qualification-hours\"\u003eQualification hours\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are hours of teaching and learning that count towards externally certified qualifications that are approved for teaching to 16 to 19 year olds under Section 96 (qualifications that are not approved under \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-96-qualifications\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSection 96\u003c/a\u003e cannot be taught in schools).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQualifications that are funded under the 16 to 19 funding methodology are identified on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Learning%20Aims/Pages/default.aspx\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLearning Aim Reference Service\u003c/a\u003e (LARS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"non-qualification-hours-employability-enrichment-and-pastoral-hours\"\u003eNon-qualification hours (employability, enrichment and pastoral hours)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are hours of fundable activity that are not used to take externally certified qualifications.

These compressed programmes enable students to complete a significant number of planned hours in a short period of time and should be linked to the student’s need to learn in this intensive way.\nCompressed study programmes are funded at the standard funding rates based on planned hours. We expect compressed study programmes to lead to excellent results, as demonstrated through qualification success rates and positive destinations. We monitor the delivery and value for money of compressed programmes to determine whether or not to take a different approach to such provision in future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"study-programmes-delivered-in-more-than-one-academic-year\"\u003eStudy programmes delivered in more than one academic year\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome students will need to have study programmes planned over more than one academic year (1 August to 31 July).

A student can be funded as full time in one year and part time in the next, or part time in both years. This will depend on the planned hours of the study programme within each academic year. Please refer to the funding bands table below for more information on how each band is calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"study-leave-and-examinations\"\u003eStudy leave and examinations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlanned hours for activity undertaken away from the institution’s premises to revise and prepare for exams can be included in a study programme.

These are not generally eligible for funding. This is because the institution has already been funded for the study programme including taking exams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere there are exceptional circumstances, such as a period of long term sickness, or good educational reasons, then the retake delivery hours for individual students may be included in the funded study programme hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a student fails to complete a learning aim in the expected time span and stays on for additional time, including revision sessions or re-sits, there is no further funding. No study hours should be included on the ILR or school census for students repeating learning or retaking examinations unless there are good educational reasons for the student to repeat part of their study programme. Retakes in GCSE English and maths are fundable to meet any condition of funding requirements. Please see the 16 to 19 \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efunding regulations\u003c/a\u003e for further information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"lunch-breaks\"\u003eLunch breaks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLunch breaks are not funded. Institutions should ensure that the planned hours exclude any lunch breaks. For example, if a student is planned to be at the institution from 10am until 4pm, and the institution regularly has a lunch break of 1 hour per student, then the planned hours recorded for that day are 5, not 6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"bank-holidays\"\u003eBank holidays\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlanned hours should not include times when the institution is closed, for example Easter or Christmas breaks. The planned hours must accurately reflect the hours a student is planned to be in learning and that cannot include periods when the institution is closed.

All fundable qualification and non-qualification activity for the academic year must be recorded individually for each student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData returns must reflect, as accurately as possible, the hours that are planned for the student at the start of their study programme. These will be the hours clearly recorded on each student’s timetable or learning agreement. Planned hours should be recorded for each student even where a group of students are studying similar qualifications. For example, a group may all be studying the same qualification but it is unlikely that other aspects of their study programme will be the same: English, maths, hours for tutorials, or for work experience may all be different. In this instance a blanket number of planned hours should not be recorded for a whole group of students, each must have their own planned hours recorded individually. Following this principle will reduce problems with data and with funding allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must make sure that the planned hours are realistic and deliverable for each student. They must have evidence of this for audit purposes and have systems in place that enable an easy reconciliation between student timetables and the planned hours recorded on the ILR or school census.

Schools and academies should make sure all planned hours are correct in time for the closure of the autumn census at the beginning of each academic year as planned hours cannot be changed after this date.\nOne exception is when students do more than one programme in a year. This applies to those who have completed all the activities on their first learning agreement or plan.

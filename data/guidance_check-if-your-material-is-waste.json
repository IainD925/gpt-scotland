The holder is the person or legal entity who has the material at the time it’s discarded. This may not be the owner – for example, if someone has leased the material, they become the holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAssessment of whether a material has been discarded is based on the actions of the holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA holder may unintentionally, involuntarily or accidentally discard a material. They may also be required to discard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Agency considers all the following factors when they assess if a material is discarded and therefore classed as waste:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eburden\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecertainty of use\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efit for purpose\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea specific purpose\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emanagement\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eenvironmental harm\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecommon classification as waste\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edisposal or recovery\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efuel or waste\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean item returned for a refund\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereuse\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll the factors must be considered. It’s not possible to decide if something has been discarded based on a single factor, unless the law specifically says that it must be disposed of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen assessing whether a material has been discarded, the Environment Agency must make sure that the aims of the Waste Framework Directive (\u003cabbr title=\"Waste Framework Directive\"\u003eWFD\u003c/abbr\u003e), which include protection of the environment and human health, are not undermined. They must take a precautionary approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"burden\"\u003eBurden\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA material is generally considered to be discarded if it is unsuitable, unwanted or surplus to requirements, making it a burden. The holder is more likely to dispose of it in a way that might harm human health or the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering the business objective of why a holder deals with a material in a particular way can help assess whether it is a burden to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"certainty-of-use\"\u003eCertainty of use\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is no certainty that a material will be used it suggests that it has been discarded. The less certain the use of a material, the more likely that it is a burden. Certainty of use is more than just the possibility of use in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fit-for-purpose\"\u003eFit for purpose\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a material cannot be used in the way it is meant to be, or it does not meet relevant standards, it strongly suggests that it has been discarded. This is because it’s unlikely to have a value to the holder or a market, so will be a burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the law states that a material has to be disposed of, the material is waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"specific-purpose\"\u003eSpecific purpose\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a holder’s material has no specific purpose, it is likely to have been discarded.

But it may not be a burden if it has some other value to the holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA material with a high economic value can still be discarded and classed as waste, such as scrap metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"management\"\u003eManagement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA material is likely to be discarded if it is managed, for example transported or stored, in a way that could damage it. Damage does not have to have occurred. If damage has occurred however, this makes it even more likely that a material has been discarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"environmental-harm\"\u003eEnvironmental harm\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a material is contaminated, and that contamination means there is a significantly greater risk of harm to the environment or human health if the material is not regulated as a waste, it is likely to be considered to have been discarded. For example, if, due to the treatment used, the burning of treated wood will cause a significantly greater risk of harm to the environment if not regulated as a waste, for example due to preservatives, the treated wood is likely to be considered waste. Whether there is significantly greater risk of harm to the environment or human health is a judgment for a technically competent person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a material has not been contaminated, it is not relevant to consider whether its storage or use is potentially harmful, as many non-waste substances can also be harmful. The environmental impact of the process to create a material or how it will be used also have no bearing on assessing if it is waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"common-classification-of-waste\"\u003eCommon classification of waste\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA material that is commonly regarded as waste is likely, but not certain, to be waste. Just because something is called waste, does not mean that it is waste. A material that is listed in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/how-to-classify-different-types-of-waste\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eList of Waste code\u003c/a\u003e is not necessarily waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"disposal-or-recovery\"\u003eDisposal or recovery\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a material has gone through an operation that is commonly regarded as disposal or recovery, it is likely to have been discarded. This will not always be so, as sometimes such an operation is not actually disposal or recovery because the material involved is not a waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, landspreading where, depending on the circumstances, the application of material to land can be recovery, disposal or neither (when spreading non-waste material for benefit to land).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you get material under a contractual agreement requiring recovery or disposal, this is evidence it’s been discarded and so is waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fuel-or-waste\"\u003eFuel or waste\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a material is commonly used as a fuel in certain circumstances, it suggests that it is likely to be fuel and not waste when used in similar circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen deciding whether a material is a fuel or a waste, it is important to look at why it is being burnt and whether it is a disposal activity. If the calorific content of a material that will be burnt is significantly less than a fuel that would be burnt as an alternative, it is likely that it is not fit for purpose and is being disposed of, making it waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"return-for-a-refund\"\u003eReturn for a refund\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a material is returned for a refund, it will not have been discarded by the holder returning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe person receiving the returned material is in a different position. Whether the material is discarded by them depends on the factors previously set out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-a-material-has-not-become-waste\"\u003eWhen a material has not become waste\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reuse\"\u003eReuse\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA material will not be waste if all the following apply:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit is used for the same purpose for which it was designed – the use must not be subordinate or incidental to the original use\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe previous holder intended for it to be reused\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eno repair, or no more than minor repair, is required to it when it is transferred from the previous holder to the new holder, and the previous holder knows this\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany necessary repair is going to be done\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eits use is lawful\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit is not managed in a way that indicates that it is waste, for example it is not transported or stored in a way that could cause it to be damaged\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a material becomes waste before it is reused, you will have to apply the end of waste test to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-by-product-test\"\u003eThe by-product test\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA production process with the primary aim of producing intended new products from non-waste materials may also produce unavoidable residues.

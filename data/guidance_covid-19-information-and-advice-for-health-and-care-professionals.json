This virus is referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated illness is known as COVID-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eolder people\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose who are pregnant\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose who are unvaccinated\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epeople of any age \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewhose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe risk of becoming seriously unwell from COVID-19 and other respiratory infections is very low for most children and young people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-background-information\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ebackground information\u003c/a\u003e on the epidemiology, virology, transmission, and clinical features of COVID-19 is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"symptoms-of-covid-19\"\u003eSymptoms of COVID-19\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCOVID-19 can present with a range of symptoms of varying severity. It is estimated that 1 in 3 people have COVID-19 without displaying any symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main symptoms include fever, a new and continuous cough, anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of other symptoms include shortness of breath, unexplained tiredness or fatigue, loss of appetite, myalgia (muscle ache), sore throat, headache, nasal congestion (stuffy nose), runny nose, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Older people may present with less common symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some individuals cough or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of smell or taste may persist for several weeks. This is not considered an indication of ongoing infection when other symptoms have resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is likely that individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who are asymptomatic can still transmit virus to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"infectious-period\"\u003eInfectious period\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn most cases, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs from 9 days before symptom onset to 15 days after symptom onset, with most transmission occurring 3 days before symptom onset to 5 days after symptom onset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeverely immunocompromised patients can remain infectious for a much longer period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is some evidence that children may be less infectious, and are infectious for a shorter period of time, compared with adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePositive lateral flow device (\u003cabbr title=\"lateral flow device\"\u003eLFD\u003c/abbr\u003e) tests have been shown to be associated with high viral load in infectious cases.

However, some hospitalised cases may be infectious for longer. It is possible for severely immunosuppressed patients to remain infectious for prolonged periods, even if they do not display any symptoms of COVID-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA locally decided protocol based on advice from medical directors, nursing directors or directors of infection prevention and control should be used to determine if isolation of inpatients with COVID-19 is needed after 5 days. \u003cabbr title=\"lateral flow device\"\u003eLFD\u003c/abbr\u003e testing may be used to support local decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe residual risk of onward transmission of COVID-19 after 2 negative \u003cabbr title=\"lateral flow device\"\u003eLFD\u003c/abbr\u003e test results on day 6 and 7, taken 24 hours apart, is similar to the risk without testing at day 10. Stepping down isolation precautions based on test results obtained earlier than day 6 slightly increases this risk, however organisations may wish to balance this risk against other potential harms to patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the patient is severely immunosuppressed or symptoms persist, consultation with the hospital microbiology, infectious diseases or infection prevention and control (\u003cabbr title=\"infection prevention and control\"\u003eIPC\u003c/abbr\u003e) team is advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn severely immunosuppressed patients, resolution of symptoms cannot be used as a marker of decreased infectiousness.

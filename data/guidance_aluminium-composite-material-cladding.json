This is in order to identify the type of aluminium composite material (\u003cabbr title=\"aluminium composite material\"\u003eACM\u003c/abbr\u003e) used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose checking tests began at the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bregroup.com/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBuilding Research Establishment (\u003cabbr title=\"Building Research Establishment\"\u003eBRE\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/a\u003e the following week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 6 July 2017, having also spoken to a group of technical experts from a wide range of professions and organisations, the expert panel recommended further large scale testing of cladding systems. This was to better understand better how different types of \u003cabbr title=\"aluminium composite material\"\u003eACM\u003c/abbr\u003e panels behave with different types of insulation in a fire (these tests can be used to show compliance with the building regulations guidance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese large scale tests, undertaken by the \u003cabbr title=\"Building Research Establishment\"\u003eBRE\u003c/abbr\u003e, looked at 3 different types of \u003cabbr title=\"aluminium composite material\"\u003eACM\u003c/abbr\u003e cladding combined with different types of insulation, in accordance with British Standard 8414. This involved building a 9-metre high demonstration wall with a complete cladding system fixed to it - including panels and insulation. This was then subjected to a fire designed to replicate the circumstances in which a severe fire breaks out of a window. The spreads of the fire up the outside wall, if any, was then monitored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-programme-update-and-consolidated-advice-for-building-owners-following-large-scale-testing\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efinal consolidated advice\u003c/a\u003e after all the tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eFire test report\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"aluminium composite material\"\u003eACM\u003c/abbr\u003e category and insulation type\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eAdvice note\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-test-report-dclg-bs-8414-test-no1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFire test report 1\u003c/a\u003e -

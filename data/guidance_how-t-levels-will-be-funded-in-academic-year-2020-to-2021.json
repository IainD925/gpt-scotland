We do not want funding to be a barrier to the introduction of T Levels. Therefore, in the early years we will be basing T Level student numbers on a planned figure agreed with providers. For the 2020 to 2021 academic year we are using the T Level student numbers submitted by providers in May 2019, based on recruitment in autumn 2020. Where necessary, as outlined in the section below for under/over delivery we will update this figure in autumn 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eT Level students will, in the main, be students who would otherwise have taken existing courses. Therefore, the funding of planned T Level student numbers will not affect a provider’s overall allocation of student numbers – only the bands in which they will be funded. The overall lagged student numbers approach as calculated for any other academic year will apply for 2020 to 2021 and will still be used as the basis for the allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly students enrolled with an \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eeligible T Level provider\u003c/a\u003e can attract additional T Level funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"funding-bands-revision\"\u003eFunding bands revision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause T Levels will include more teaching hours and be more prescriptive in their content than study programmes, we are adding 4 larger funding bands to the existing 5 bands.

There may be a small number of exceptional circumstances where it is appropriate for the provider to plan to deliver fewer than the minimum number of hours. This may be where the student has already completed the learning required, for example a level 2 qualification in a related subject. In such cases and where the provider considers sufficient prior learning has taken place and studying the full content of the T Level is unnecessary a lower number of planned hours should be recorded, and the funding rate for the appropriate lower band will apply. All the other elements of the T Level that would result in extra funding will still apply and therefore must be recorded correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis approach will apply whether the planned hours recorded fall into a T Level band or bands 1 to 5.

There may however be some students who have sufficient prior learning that the provider considers it is in the best interest of the student to join a group part way through the year rather than wait until the next year. In these instances, the total planned hours for the length of the T Level should be recorded, and we will calculate the level of funding that will apply to those planned hours. This funding will then be spread over the length of the T Level programme in a similar way that applies to part year study programmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"students-undertaking-a-t-level-programme-and-a-study-programme-in-the-same-funding-year\"\u003eStudents undertaking a T Level programme and a study programme in the same funding year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ESFA will not fund students to take more than one full time study programme or the equivalent in multiple part time programmes in one institution in one funding year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe expect students to be undertaking a study programme or a T Level programme in one funding year and not both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf in exceptional circumstances a student does progress from a study programme to a T Level part way through the funding year they will be funded as per any other T Level student generating a full year’s worth of T Level funding in year 1 and in year 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the student then continues their T Level into year 3 due to the late start in year 1 there will be no further funding for year 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eTransition programme\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eYear 1\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eYear 2\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eYear 3\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eTotal funding\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"row\"\u003eT Level\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eWhole of year 1 funded at T Level rate\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eWhole of year 2 funded at T Level rate\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eNot funded\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e \u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e \u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£5,061\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£5,061\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£0\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£10,122\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"funding-for-t-level-transition-programme\"\u003eFunding for T Level Transition Programme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDelivery of the Transition Programme is expected to be through the standard study programme funding system and rates as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/t-level-funding-consultation-launched\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eT Level Consultation\u003c/a\u003e (November 2018)  and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/funding-for-the-delivery-of-t-levels\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGovernment response\u003c/a\u003e (June 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also intend to apply programme cost weighting (\u003cabbr title=\"programme cost weighting\"\u003ePCW\u003c/abbr\u003e) to students on the T Level Transition Programme.

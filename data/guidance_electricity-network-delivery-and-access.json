This will significantly reduce network congestion (known as ‘transmission constraints’), which National Grid has to resolve by calling on generators to either increase or decrease the amount of electricity they have planned and committed to provide to suppliers. Most constraint payments are legitimate and compensate generators for the costs incurred when having to reduce or increase the amount of electricity they have planned and committed to provide to suppliers.

The GB regulatory regime for the construction and operation of offshore transmission assets is designed to provide flexibility for generators in terms of who constructs the assets as well as cost-effectiveness to consumers and generators from its competitive tender process.

OFTO’s are selected on a competitive basis through a tender process run by Ofgem, the GB energy regulator, who have confirmed that this approach has saved £200-£400 million on the first tranche of projects alone.  There has been significant interest in the OFTO market from new entrants to the sector, with almost £4 billion of bids for the first £1.1 billion of assets tendered by Ofgem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/transmission-networks/offshore-transmission\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFurther details on the offshore transmission regime and OFTO tender round\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"interconnection\"\u003eInterconnection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther interconnection can contribute to our security, affordability and decarbonisation objectives, as well as towards a single European electricity market. Great Britain has 4GW of interconnection – 2GW with France, 1GW with the Netherlands, 500MW with Northern Ireland and 500MW with the Republic of Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Government has supported around 6GW of interconnection projects to benefit from European \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/infrastructure/projects-common-interest\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eProject of Common Interest (PCI)\u003c/a\u003e status, with benefits including enhanced permitting procedures, potential regulatory incentives and access to funding under the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-energy-projects-awarded-75-million-of-european-funding\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eConnecting Europe Facility\u003c/a\u003e. In December 2013, the government published the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/more-interconnection-improving-energy-security-and-lowering-bills\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e“More interconnection: improving energy security, lowering bills policy paper”\u003c/a\u003e setting out our commitment and activity underway to achieve it. This led to recent announcements that interconnected capacity will be able to to participate in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electricity-market-reform-capacity-market\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCapacity Market\u003c/a\u003e in the 2015 auction. The independent regulator, Ofgem, has also put in place a ‘cap and floor’ regulatory framework, which aims to incentivise further investment in interconnection by reducing the downside revenue risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a number projects in the pipeline to increase GB interconnection capacity, which could provide billions of pounds of additional investment in electricity networks. The Nemo (1GW to Belgium) and NSN (1.4GW to Norway) interconnectors both reached financial investment decision early in 2015, which marks a major milestone towards seeing these interconnectors become operational. Ofgem has granted initial approval for three further interconnectors which could be operational by 2020, providing an additional 3.4GW of capacity to France and Denmark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA UK-Iceland Energy Task Force was also set up in October 2015 to consider whether further investigation of an interconnector project between the UK and Iceland might have merit through identifying common ground between the two parties. The taskforce concluded in May 2016 and issued a joint statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7ff81b40f0b62302690b88/icelandstatement.pdf\"\u003eUK-Iceland energy task force signed statement\u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e355 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e2 pages\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/electricity/transmission-networks/electricity-interconnectors\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDetails on the GB interconnection regime\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorical announcements and publications for this page can be accessed via the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/adv_search/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enational archives\u003c/a\u003e by searching for ‘Electricity network delivery and access’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

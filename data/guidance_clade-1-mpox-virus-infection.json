There are 2 distinct clades of the virus: Clade I and Clade II. Clade II \u003cabbr title=\"mpox virus\"\u003eMPXV\u003c/abbr\u003e is responsible for the global outbreak that began in 2022. Clade I \u003cabbr title=\"mpox virus\"\u003eMPXV\u003c/abbr\u003e is currently considered more severe than Clade II \u003cabbr title=\"mpox virus\"\u003eMPXV\u003c/abbr\u003e, leading to its classification as a high consequence infectious disease (\u003cabbr title=\"high consequence infectious disease\"\u003eHCID\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, Clade I \u003cabbr title=\"mpox virus\"\u003eMPXV\u003c/abbr\u003e has been reported only in 5 Central African countries. However, recent cases in additional countries within Central and East Africa mark the first known expansion of its geographical range, heightening the risk of spread beyond the region. Evidence of sustained sexual transmission of Clade I \u003cabbr title=\"mpox virus\"\u003eMPXV\u003c/abbr\u003e has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u003cabbr title=\"Democratic Republic of Congo\"\u003eDRC\u003c/abbr\u003e). Healthcare professionals should remain vigilant for Clade I \u003cabbr title=\"mpox virus\"\u003eMPXV\u003c/abbr\u003e, including in sexually acquired mpox cases, and should obtain comprehensive travel histories from patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe symptoms of mpox begin 5 to 21 days (average 6 to 16 days) after exposure with initial clinical presentation of fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and headache. Within 1 to 5 days after the appearance of fever, a rash develops, often beginning on the face or genital area and it may then spread to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab which later falls off.

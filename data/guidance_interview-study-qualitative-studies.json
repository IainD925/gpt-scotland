These involve open-ended discussion with the participant, guided by a pre-existing plan. Write a discussion guide with a few important questions in advance and use this to guide your conversation. The guide may evolve for later interviews based on responses in earlier interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews can vary in length depending on the context, 20 minutes to an hour is common. Make sure the participant does not feel time-pressured or distracted. You should try to establish a rapport with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes participants are given a task to do before the interview, such as using the product.\nYou may need fewer participants for an interview study than for a quantitative study. One approach is to keep recruiting participants until you are not getting any new insights from extra interviews (saturation of answers).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should record the interview, using one or more of these methods:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eaudio recordings\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003evideo recordings\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enotes taken by the evaluator or an assistant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTaking notes is a useful back-up if the recording fails, but note-taking should not get in the way of establishing a rapport with the interviewee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTranscribe the recordings after the interviews and try to review the transcripts soon after each interview. You may want to share transcripts with participants, allowing them to add to their comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews can be carried out in person, by telephone or video conference. They can be carried out via text communication, such as email, but you may get less rich answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews are usually analysed using \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analyse-your-data-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethematic analysis\u003c/a\u003e or other qualitative data analysis methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-physical-activity-apps-for-cancer-survivors\"\u003eExample: physical activity apps for cancer survivors\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRoberts and others (2019), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e10918/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBreast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors’ Experiences of Using Publicly Available Physical Activity Mobile Apps: Qualitative Study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team wanted to evaluate 4 existing apps for the promotion of physical activity to see whether they would work well for cancer survivors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey chose an interview study because the work was at an early stage of development. They were working out what sort of app or features would work for this patient group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecruitment was done through the support of community-based cancer support groups, Facebook cancer support groups and charities.

Each participant was then randomly assigned 2 of the 4 apps and instructed to use them for a week each consecutively. Afterwards, they were interviewed over the telephone using a discussion guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eForty participants were recruited, but 8 dropped out, so 32 completed the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe interviews were recorded and transcribed.

This guidance helps to explain the bankruptcy process and answer questions you may have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-bankruptcy-process-and-enquiry-letter-b10a\"\u003eThe bankruptcy process and enquiry letter B10A\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-bankruptcy-process\"\u003eThe bankruptcy process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two ways in which someone can be declared bankrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIf a person in debt (a debtor) wants to declare themselves bankrupt, they will apply to an Adjudicator in the Insolvency Service by completing an online declaration of assets. The Adjudicator will decide whether or not to make a bankruptcy order.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIf someone who is owed money (a creditor) wants to make a debtor bankrupt, they have to issue court proceedings against that person and ask the court to make a bankruptcy order.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe courts and the Insolvency Service must inform us when bankruptcy proceedings have started, and when a bankruptcy order has been made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Land Charges Department, which is part of HM Land Registry, has to maintain a register which records the names and details of people affected by bankruptcy proceedings and bankruptcy orders, as provided by the courts and Insolvency Service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe must also record details of bankruptcy proceedings and bankruptcy orders in the title register of any property which appears to be owned by the affected person. To find out which title registers may be affected, we compare the names of debtors or bankrupts that have been added to the Land Charges register with our index of names of people who own registered land (the index of registered proprietors).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-bankruptcy-enquiry-letter-b10a\"\u003eThe bankruptcy enquiry letter B10A\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur Bankruptcy Unit needs to find out whether you are the person named in the bankruptcy proceedings.\nYour name appears to be the same as that of a debtor or bankrupt person that the Insolvency Service or the\ncourts have told us about. This is not unusual, as there are often many people who have the same name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe receive only limited information, particularly from the courts, so it is difficult for us to identify whether the\ndebtor or bankrupt and the registered property owner are the same person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople may own more than one property and those properties could be in any part of England or Wales. We\ntherefore send an enquiry letter to registered property owners who have the same name as the person affected\nby bankruptcy proceedings, asking whether they are the person named in the proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-identity-information\"\u003eOther Identity information\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdentity details such as birth dates or national insurance numbers are not recorded in the title register or in the index of registered proprietors. Even if we did have access to such information we would still not be able to match the names of people mentioned in bankruptcy proceedings with registered property owners in every case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"identity-fraud\"\u003eIdentity fraud\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur enquiry does not mean that someone has fraudulently used your identity. It is simply that a person named in bankruptcy proceedings happens to have the same name as you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"details-of-the-bankrupt-person\"\u003eDetails of the bankrupt person\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe information about the bankruptcy proceedings is a matter of public record. We have included it in the B10A enquiry letter so that you can contact the courts or the Adjudicator Office for more information if you wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"wrong-address\"\u003eWrong address\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe B10A enquiry letter may have been sent to an address where you don’t live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the property was registered in your name, the details of your address that you or your solicitor provided on the application form were entered in the title register. This is the address that we use to contact you. It is your responsibility to keep your address up to date in the register and it is very important that you do this.

The law requires us to make an entry in the title register in order to protect the interests of people who are owed money.

If you are the bankrupt \nperson, you will need to seek independent legal advice.

The guide is not mandatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities must consider the risks to funding and need for assurance for their own direct provision, including local authority maintained schools with sixth forms, but it is for chief financial officers to determine whether and how work is undertaken to enable them to make their grant returns to ESFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"important-points\"\u003eImportant points\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Funds are subject to normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should ensure they have appropriate processes in place to record bursary applications and awards (including the number, value, purpose, whether awarded or not, and a brief justification for the decision based on the institution’s assessment of each student’s actual needs). They must also be able to confirm, during any audit, the amount of any unspent funds that have been carried forward to the current academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe audit guide is designed to operate in conjunction with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2021-to-2022-academic-year\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide\u003c/a\u003e, which provides more information about eligibility and processes.

This ensures payments are made in accordance with ESFA requirements set out in the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA suggests that local authorities may wish to consider an integrated approach to individual audits at institutions. This means undertaking 16 to 19 Bursary Fund audits when they visit an institution to perform audit work in other areas, for example, the funding audit at maintained school sixth forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities can obtain assurance over 16 to 19 Bursary Funding in a number of different ways, for example, controls review/evaluation with walkthrough/compliance testing and/or the substantive testing of individual students. Local authorities have discretion to decide which type of audit testing they undertake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/606d83e7d3bf7f400cd5c12e/LA_16_to_19_financial_support_-_21-22.xlsm\"\u003eESFA audit working papers\u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e80.8 KB\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e that accompany this guide include a controls questionnaire. The questionnaire sets out the key areas where assurance is needed and can be completed through discussions with the institution. Identified control weaknesses and suggestions for improvement should be reported to the institution by completing the relevant column in the document. The working papers include both bursary funding and free meals in further education though local authorities will not usually need to use the free meals sections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/606d83e7d3bf7f400cd5c12e/LA_16_to_19_financial_support_-_21-22.xlsm\"\u003eESFA audit working papers\u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e80.8 KB\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e also include a substantial testing programme. This sets out detailed checks that ensure funding is being used appropriately. It may be helpful if local authorities decide to carry out this type of testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA gives institutions a 5 day grace period in which to resolve any errors identified during an audit; for example, to provide missing evidence or documentation. Local authorities may wish to adopt the same approach but this is not mandatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe working papers also include an error summary that can be used to record any actual payment errors identified and any recovery action taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"error-criteria\"\u003eError criteria\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will recover funds in the following circumstances if identified in an audit of 16 to 19 Bursary Funds:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhere institutions cannot demonstrate each student meets the eligibility criteria.

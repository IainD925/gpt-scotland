Understanding the opportunities and challenges of civilian housing is key to planning post-service accommodation needs. This includes understanding your rights and responsibilities regarding your service accommodation. These can be found in the service leavers guide referenced below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"non-military-housing-options-for-serving-personnel\"\u003eNon-military housing options for serving personnel\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two types of non-military housing that serving personnel and their families might be able to access:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePrivate Sector Housing\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSocial Housing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"private-sector-housing\"\u003ePrivate sector housing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately 80% of civilians in England live in private housing, of which there are two types, private rental and private ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"private-rental\"\u003ePrivate rental\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you rent a private property, you do not own that property but instead you sign a rental agreement with the landlord (property owner or property management company) to become a tenant. This will entitle you to stay in that property for an agreed period of time provided you continue to meet the conditions of the agreement. This will include making regular, typically monthly, rental payments to a landlord. You will also likely be required to pay an upfront amount as a deposit. This is typically a multiple of the monthly rental amount but will differ from property to property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/private-renting\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePlease click here for more information about renting a private property\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"private-ownership\"\u003ePrivate ownership\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuying a home is often the largest purchase you will make in your lifetime and for most people this will require a specific property purchasing loan called a mortgage.

You will often find yourself in competition with others who would also like to live in that property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to understand that the cost of private sector housing does not simply reflect the purchase or rental price and will almost certainly be far greater than that paid for service accommodation. In addition to the property itself you will also have to meet numerous other housing costs, such as council tax, broadband, repairs and maintenance, insurance, utilities and furniture, which is not necessarily the case when living in service accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"accessing-the-private-sector-housing-market\"\u003eAccessing the private sector housing market\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal estate agents are the main source of information for available private housing in a particular area, most of which will have websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also a number of nationwide websites that bring together information from individual estate agents around the country. These enable you to search for properties in an area or by type from multiple individual estate agents. These can be accessed using standard on-line search engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt typically takes between 3-6 months to purchase a home in England once the desired property has been identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"specific-schemes-or-support-for-serving-personnel\"\u003eSpecific schemes or support for serving personnel\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"surplus-service-family-accommodation\"\u003eSurplus Service Family Accommodation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSurplus Service Family Accommodation (SFA) may be allocated to serving personnel recently who are retired or redundant from service, to assist with the transition to civilian life or for the purpose of house hunting, for a maximum period of 12 months at market rates.

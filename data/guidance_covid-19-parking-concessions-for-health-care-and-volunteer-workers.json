This brings the temporary national parking pass scheme to an end. \n   \nNHS staff continue to be eligible for free parking in hospital car parks.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual councils are responsible for setting their own local policy on parking and many offer their own local concessions for health workers and other groups. Therefore, healthcare workers and others interested in local parking concessions are advised to check their local councils’ website for details of any local schemes.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find contact details for your local council using this \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esearch tool\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

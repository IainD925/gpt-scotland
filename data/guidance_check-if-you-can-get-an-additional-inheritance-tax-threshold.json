This is the residence nil rate band (\u003cabbr title=\"residence nil rate band\"\u003eRNRB\u003c/abbr\u003e). The extra amount for 2021 to 2026 is up to £175,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the person who died did not use their residence nil rate band, you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inheritance-tax-transfer-of-threshold\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etransfer the unused threshold\u003c/a\u003e to a surviving spouse or civil partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"find-out-how-to-qualify-for-residence-nil-rate-band\"\u003eFind out how to qualify for residence nil rate band\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo qualify, the person who died must have left their home, or a share of it, to their \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inheritance-tax-residence-nil-rate-band\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edirect descendants\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA person does not have to leave the whole of the home to direct descendants. If they only inherit a share of the home, you calculate the available residence nil rate band on the basis of the value of that share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe estate may also qualify if the person \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-downsizing-selling-or-gifting-a-home-affects-the-additional-inheritance-tax-threshold\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edownsized to a lower value property\u003c/a\u003e, or sold or gave away their home on or after 8 July 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"example\"\u003eExample\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA woman dies in tax year 2020 to 2021.

But, the actual residence allowance for the estate is restricted to £175,000. This is the lower of the maximum available allowance for tax year 2020 to 2021 (£175,000) and value of the half share of the home (£250,000).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not matter how the step-son inherits the home. The home could be left to the step-son as a specific legacy in the will, or it could be included in what’s left of the estate (the residue) after specific legacies have been taken into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"homes-that-qualify\"\u003eHomes that qualify\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one home will qualify for the available residence nil rate band. If the person who died owned and lived in more than one home, the executor can choose which one to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe person that died must have owned and lived in the property at some time. A property that they owned but never lived in, such as a buy-to-let, will not qualify for this allowance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be able to claim residence nil rate band by \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-downsizing-selling-or-gifting-a-home-affects-the-additional-inheritance-tax-threshold\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eclaiming a downsizing addition\u003c/a\u003e if the person who died either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edid not own a home because they sold or gave it away on or after 8 July 2015\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edownsized to a less valuable home that’s below the maximum threshold on or after 8 July 2015\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the home, or the share of the home, was held in a trust before the person died or is transferred to a trust when they die, you may be able to claim the residence nil rate band depending on the type of trust.

People who are not domiciled in the UK are only subject to Inheritance Tax on their assets in the UK, so the home must be in the UK to be within the scope of Inheritance Tax and within their estate when they die.

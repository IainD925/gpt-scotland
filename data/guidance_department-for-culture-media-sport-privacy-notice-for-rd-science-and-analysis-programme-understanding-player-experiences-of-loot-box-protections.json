A data subject is someone who can be recognised, directly or indirectly, by information such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or data relating to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. These types of identifying information are known as ‘personal data’.

The project will follow two stages. Stage 1 will require the supplier to establish a methodology for working with loot box data and population samples. This stage is theoretical and will not require any data collection. Stage 2 will address key questions to assess the effectiveness of industry-led measures recently introduced to improve player protections. This stage will in part be underpinned by new data collected for this project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, the new data collected for this project will be used to address the following DCMS research questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat proportion of parents or guardians authorise their child’s loot box purchases (including those using technological controls, and those who authorise purchases via an offline arrangement with their child)?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat proportion of children are purchasing loot boxes without their parent’s awareness and/or consent?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDo all players purchasing loot boxes, including high spending players, have access to and awareness of spending controls and transparent information to support safe and responsible gameplay?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe findings of this research will inform the DCMS evidence base on lootboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-legal-basis-for-processing-my-data\"\u003eWhat is the legal basis for processing my data?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote that we are only collecting data from individuals based on fully informed consent that may be withdrawn at any point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo process this personal data, our legal reason for collecting or processing this data is: Article 6(1)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ee. it is necessary to perform a public task (to carry out a public function or exercise powers set out in law, or to perform a specific task in the public interest that is set out in law)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawful basis that we rely on to process your personal data will determine which of the following rights are available to you.

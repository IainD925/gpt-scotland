It is not present in the United Kingdom (UK), nor are there any identified established populations of Hyalomma ticks, the principal vectors of \u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\"\u003eCCHF\u003c/abbr\u003e virus (\u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus\"\u003eCCHFV\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\"\u003eCCHF\u003c/abbr\u003e was first described in the Crimea in 1944, among soldiers and agricultural workers, and in 1969 it was recognised that the virus causing the disease was identical to a virus isolated from a child in the Congo in 1956. Humans (and possibly non-human primates) are the only animal species known to manifest severe clinical \u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\"\u003eCCHF\u003c/abbr\u003e disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"epidemiology\"\u003eEpidemiology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\"\u003eCCHF\u003c/abbr\u003e has a widespread geographical distribution (see below maps and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-disease-country-specific-risk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"high consequence infectious disease\"\u003eHCID\u003c/abbr\u003e: country specific risk webpage\u003c/a\u003e). It is considered endemic in countries in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and western and south-central Asia. It is estimated that globally between 10,000 and 15,000 human infections, including approximately 500 fatalities, occur annually, although this is likely to be an underestimate as many cases may be subclinical or unrecognised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe global distribution of human cases corresponds to the geographical range of established Hyalomma tick species, notably H. marginatum and H. lusitanicum, which are considered the primary vectors of \u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus\"\u003eCCHFV\u003c/abbr\u003e. These ticks commonly infest livestock and other animals. Although small mammals are involved in the disease cycle, the principal reservoir are ticks. Ticks can transmit the virus sexually, and to their offspring. Once infected, the tick carries the virus for life, and passes it to animals or humans when it bites them. Domestic ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats carry the virus for around one week after becoming infected, but do not show symptoms. Domestic and wild mammals act as disease amplifiers and can transport the disease to adjacent areas. Many bird species carry Hyalomma ticks, but most birds are thought to be relatively resistant to infection with \u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\"\u003eCCHF\u003c/abbr\u003e virus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGlobally, there have been case reports, virological or serological evidence of human infection in at least 55 countries. In the European Region and its neighbouring countries, locally acquired human cases and/or outbreaks have been reported from Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Russia, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine. Spain officially reported its first autochthonous case in August 2016, the first in Western Europe, following their first detection of \u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus\"\u003eCCHFV\u003c/abbr\u003e infected ticks in 2010. At the end of October 2023, French officials reported the detection of \u003cabbr title=\"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus\"\u003eCCHFV\u003c/abbr\u003e in H. marginatum ticks collected from cattle in the eastern Pyrénées, which was the first time the presence of the virus in tick populations had been confirmed in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"figure-1-maps-of-human-cchf-cases-in-a-europe-b-asia-and-c-africa\"\u003eFigure 1.

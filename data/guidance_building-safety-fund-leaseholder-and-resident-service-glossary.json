DLUHC’s appeals team assess appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor BSF 2022, the application process is different, drawing on a Fire Risk Appraisal of External Walls (FRAEW) following the PAS 9980:2022 methodology. The application process will offer the opportunity for applicants to provide additional information and further clarification. If we are unable to assure the FRAEW, this will be detailed in writing along with next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"building-safety-fund-bsf\"\u003eBuilding Safety Fund (BSF)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Building Safety Fund (BSF) is a government fund, introduced in 2020, to pay for the remediation of cladding on buildings over 17.7 metres high in England. A building’s responsible entity can apply to the BSF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe BSF opened for new applications on 28 July 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cladding-systems-acm-and-non-acm\"\u003eCladding systems (ACM and non-ACM)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA cladding system is the outer part of an external wall construction. A cladding system comprises the components attached to the exterior of a building to form the weatherproof covering. A cladding system can include cladding panels, fillers (or the core material of a cladding panel), insulation, membranes, brackets, cavity barriers, flashing, fixings, gaskets and sealants. It normally includes the components from the weather-exposed outer layer through to the sheathing board. It does not include the inner part of an external wall construction such as steel or timber framing systems, insulation installed within the framing system, plasterboard or internal finishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eACM refers to Aluminium Composite Materials while non-ACM refers to non-Aluminium Composite Material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"consolidated-advice-note-can\"\u003eConsolidated Advice Note (CAN)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2020, the government published advice for building owners on the assessment of non-ACM external wall systems. That advice represented the Expert Panel’s position on the action that building owners should take to address the risk of fire spread from unsafe external wall systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-advice-for-building-owners-including-fire-doors\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eConsolidated Advice Note\u003c/a\u003e was withdrawn on 10 January 2022 (please refer to Fire Risk Appraisal of External Wall construction for more information).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"delivery-partner\"\u003eDelivery partner\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe delivery partner is responsible for the administration of BSF applications.

An economic actor isn’t necessarily a single person; for instance, it could be a partnership, a family trust or a company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"fire-risk-appraisal-of-external-wall-fraew\"\u003eFire Risk Appraisal of External Wall (FRAEW)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2022/january/code-of-practice-for-the-fire-risk-appraisal-of-external-wall-construction-and-cladding-of-existing-blocks-of-flats-published/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFire Risk Appraisal of External Walls (FRAEW)\u003c/a\u003e is undertaken by fire safety professionals.

However, they only act on behalf of the responsible entity who retains the legal right to carry out works to address fire risks associated with cladding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"partial-eligibility\"\u003ePartial eligibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne or more (but not all) cladding system(s) on the building have been found to be eligible under the BSF criteria. The BSF 2020 criteria focused on establishing the fire classification of cladding and insulation materials.

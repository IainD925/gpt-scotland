For care to be integrated, organisations and care professionals need to bring together all of the different elements of care that a person needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA person’s care may be provided by several different health and social care professionals, across different providers. As a result people can experience health and social care services that are fragmented, difficult to access and not based around their (or their carers’) needs.

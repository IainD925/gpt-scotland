The British High Commission advises potential purchasers to exercise extreme caution when buying a property if the title deeds are not readily available, as it means your property could be at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"mortgage-liability\"\u003eMortgage liability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is common practice for developers to take out mortgages on land or property. If you sign a contract with a developer and there is already a mortgage, loan or claim on the property, then you are likely to become liable for that mortgage should the builder, developer or landowner declare bankruptcy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should ask your lawyer to check for mortgages placed on the land through a Land Search Certificate which is obtained from the Land Registry. It should be noted that in order to obtain a Land Search Certificate one requires a relevant authorisation from the Property’s owner. If you are made aware of a mortgage before signing a contract it is unlikely that you will obtain the deeds in your name until the mortgage is paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLawyers are not required to check for mortgages automatically, although good lawyers should do this as a matter of course. In 2011 the Republic of Cyprus Government introduced a Specific Performance Law to give a contract of sale precedence over any pre-existing mortgage however we still strongly recommend that you check no mortgages have been placed on the land prior to purchase to ensure you do not run into potential difficulties at a later date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther issues most frequently raised by British nationals include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elawyers acting for both vendors or builders therefore not independent\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebuilding works taking place without the correct planning permission or building permit (eg electricity or water)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efluctuations in currency and interest rates affecting mortgages\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epayment plans or fees not being included in the initial contract\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edifficulty in obtaining certificates of final completion (deeds cannot be issued without this)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edifficulty in obtaining title deeds\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edifficulty in obtaining redress after problems are identified\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith all property purchases, we strongly recommend that you seek your own independent legal advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have purchased a property or land and are encountering difficulties, you should seek qualified independent legal advice on your rights and methods of redress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Foreign, Commonwealth \u0026amp; Development Office (FCDO) and the British High Commission are not able to offer legal advice or become involved with disputes between private parties. However, we direct British nationals to organisations who may be able to help and we can raise systemic issues, problems which affect a number of customers, with local authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can check on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.aipp.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAssociation of International Property Professionals website\u003c/a\u003e to see if a company or legal advisor are members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"buying-property-in-the-north-of-cyprus\"\u003eBuying property in the north of Cyprus\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ownership of many properties is disputed in the north of Cyprus, with thousands of claims to ownership from people displaced in 1974. Purchase of these properties could have serious financial and legal implications. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled in a number of cases that owners of property in northern Cyprus before 1974 continue to be regarded as the legal owners of that property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePurchasers could face legal proceedings in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as attempts to enforce judgments from these courts elsewhere in the EU, including the UK. There has been at least one successful case to enforce rulings in the UK, putting at risk property owned in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe leaders of both communities are currently in negotiations to try to solve the Cyprus issue. One key issue is property and the handling of pre-1974 Greek Cypriot title-owned property. Property owners and potential purchasers should also consider that a future settlement of the Cyprus issue could have serious consequences for property they purchase, including the possible restitution of the property to its original owner, in addition to compensation payments. In particular, prospective purchasers should consider the implications of any future settlement on land/property:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein the north of Cyprus that was owned by a Greek Cypriot national prior to 1974\n*^that was subsequently classified as exchange or ‘gift’ land/property by the Turkish Cypriot “authorities”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePurchasers should ensure they are fully aware of the rules in the north of Cyprus in respect of foreigners purchasing property, including the requirement to obtain consent to the transfer of property. Even when purchasing pre-1974 Turkish title land, you may still be refused permission to purchase the land/property and no reason for the refusal may be given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 20 October 2006, an amendment to the Republic of Cyprus criminal code relating to property came into effect. Under the amendment, buying, selling, renting, promoting or mortgaging a property without the permission of the owner (the person whose ownership is registered with the Republic of Cyprus Land Registry, including Greek Cypriots displaced from northern Cyprus in 1974) is a criminal offence. The maximum prison sentence is 7 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amendment to the law also states that any attempt to undertake such a transaction is a criminal offence and could result in a prison sentence of up to 5 years. This law is not retrospective, so will not criminalise transactions that took place before 20 October 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso documents relating to the purchase of property in the north of Cyprus will be presumed by the Cypriot authorities to relate to the illegal transfer of Greek Cypriot property and may be subject to confiscation when crossing the Green Line. Anyone found in possession of these documents may be asked to make a statement to the Cypriot authorities and could face criminal proceedings under the 20 October amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny enquiries regarding the scope of this law should be made to the Republic of Cyprus High Commission in London or to the Ministry of Foreign affairs for the Republic of Cyprus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"address\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"adr org fn\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nRoC High Commission London \n\u003cbr\u003e13, St James\u0027s Square \n\u003cbr\u003eLondon SW1Y 4LB \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone: +44 (0) 207 3214 100\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmail: \u003ca href=\"mailto:cyprusinuk@mfa.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecyprusinuk@mfa.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"address\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"adr org fn\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nRoC Ministry of Foreign Affairs \n\u003cbr\u003ePresidential Palace Avenue \n\u003cbr\u003e1447 Nicosia \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTelephone: +357 22651000\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFax: +357 22661881\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuty Officer: +357 99 660129 (for emergency assistance and strictly after office hours: 07:30 – 16:00 (Monday - Friday)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmail: \u003ca href=\"mailto:info@mfa.gov.cy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003einfo@mfa.gov.cy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"property-owned-before-1974\"\u003eProperty owned before 1974\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a British national and owned a property in the north of Cyprus before 1974 (or the heir of someone meeting those criteria), please contact the British High Commission by email, marking your message to the attention of the Property Officer.

Failure to obtain the consent of the Administrator means that the acquisition and registration of the immovable property in question is null and void. The Administrator will give consent only in the most exceptional circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also be aware that it is an offence for persons other than “recognised residents” to live in the SBAs for more than 28 days in any period of 12 months, except in accordance with a permit issued under that Ordinance.

Compulsory purchase powers can support the delivery of a range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects in the public interest. In doing so, they can help to bring about improvements to social, economic and environmental wellbeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.\tAlthough compulsory purchase powers can help to deliver positive change, the government recognises that it can be upsetting and stressful to discover that land which you own or occupy is to be compulsorily acquired. Furthermore, the law and procedures relating to compulsory purchase are complex, which can be daunting. This series of 4 plain English guides is intended to help those affected by compulsory purchase by explaining how the system works in simple terms. The guides reflect legislative changes up to and including the Neighbourhood Planning Act 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.\tBefore reading this guide, you should first read Guide 1 which provides an end-to-end overview of the compulsory purchase order (\u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e) process in England and Wales. It outlines the procedures which acquiring authorities must go through to use their powers and explains what opportunities those affected have to influence the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.\tThis guide – Guide 3 – deals solely with the issue of compensation for owners and occupiers of agricultural land affected by a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e.

The compensation and valuation principles explained in these guides apply to all compulsory purchase schemes, regardless of the type of legal instrument being used: this includes CPOs, Transport and Works Act Orders (TWAOs), development consent orders (DCOs) and Hybrid Acts of Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.\tThese guides are aimed at the layperson, and wherever possible, the use of jargon and technical language has been avoided. There are, however, a number of important terms which have specific meaning in compulsory purchase matters. These words and expressions are explained within \u003ca href=\"#link_appendix1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAppendix 1\u003c/a\u003e of this guide. There are also a number of bodies and organisations who may be able to offer their advice if you are affected by compulsory purchase.

The information they contain carries no legal force and does not constitute legal advice. The guides are not a substitute for professional advice. If you think your land may be the subject of compulsory purchase you should seek advice from a suitably experienced property adviser such as a chartered surveyor, an agricultural valuer or a solicitor, who should be able to advise on your rights and also act on your behalf if appropriate.

You should also keep detailed records of all expenses incurred and losses sustained as you may be able to recover these as part of your claim for compensation. You should bear in mind that you can only receive compensation for expenses and losses which occur as a direct and reasonable consequence of the acquisition of your land.

This means that you need to take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce your losses. For example, if you need to employ a removals firm to assist with your move, you should obtain quotes from at least 2 reputable firms. Assuming the firms offer the same service, instructing the cheapest would be a way of mitigating your loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"outline-of-the-compensation-system\"\u003eOutline of the compensation system\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e12.\tThis guide provides a description of the statutory framework for compensation.

Your professional adviser will be able to advise if any such schemes exist and are relevant to your particular case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e13.\tThe rights to compensation for those affected by compulsory purchase - and the procedures for assessing the correct amount – are governed by a combination of legislation, case law and established practice. These are sometimes referred to collectively as the ‘compensation code’. However, there is no single, published document called the compensation code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e14.\tThe overriding principle of compulsory purchase compensation is ‘equivalence’. This is the principle that people whose land is acquired compulsorily should be left neither better nor worse off financially as a result of their land being acquired – being entitled to compensation which is neither more nor less than the value of their loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"right-to-compensation\"\u003eRight to compensation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e15.\tThe right to compensation may arise as a result of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eall or part of your land, or a right over that land, being acquired compulsorily (or under the threat of compulsory purchase) – depending upon the particular circumstances in each case, compensation can be claimed under the following categories, which are referred to as ‘heads of claim’:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003evalue of the land taken (see \u003ca href=\"#link_para23\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraphs 23 to 38\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003edisturbance payments (see \u003ca href=\"#link_para40\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraphs 40 to 47\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eloss payments (see \u003ca href=\"#link_para47\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraphs 47 to 51\u003c/a\u003e); and\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eseverance and injurious affection for retained land (see \u003ca href=\"#link_para53\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraphs 53 to 60\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eyour land being adversely affected by the construction and/or use of works but where none of your land is acquired - compensation can be claimed for a reduction in the value of your land caused by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003ethe execution (the construction) of public works (injurious affection) (see \u003ca href=\"#link_para106\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraphs 106 to 108\u003c/a\u003e); and\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003ethe subsequent use of public works (Part 1 claim) (see \u003ca href=\"#link_para109\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraphs 109 to 119\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"mitigation-works\"\u003eMitigation works\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e16.\tAcquiring authorities also have certain duties and discretionary powers to take action to help to reduce the impact of their development works. The exercise of these powers is referred to as ‘mitigating the injurious effects’ of the development. The main duty is a requirement to undertake noise insulation works where certain specified criteria are fulfilled. This duty only applies to dwellings or other buildings used for residential purposes. Your professional adviser will be able to provide further advice on this matter.

The valuation will reflect the likely development costs, as well as uncertainties and risks, associated with implementing an alternative development in the absence of the acquiring authority’s scheme.

Therefore, if your land is used for a purpose which requires, but does not have, planning permission, no account can be taken of any increase in value attributable to that use.

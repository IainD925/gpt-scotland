Charities can take part in political activity that supports their purpose and is in their best interests, but they must follow the law when doing so. When charities engage in political campaigning, we also encourage them to do so in a way that promotes respect, tolerance and consideration for others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"engaging-with-charities-during-an-election-campaign-as-a-candidate\"\u003eEngaging with charities during an election campaign as a candidate\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-i-hire-facilities-owned-by-charities\"\u003eCan I hire facilities owned by charities?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Many charities own premises which they may choose to rent out as a means of generating income. During the period around an election, charities may decide to rent out their premises to political parties or other groups at the going rate. Where this occurs, charities will need to ensure that their decision making on whether to accept or refuse a booking does not call into question the charity’s independence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA charity must never deliberately use its funds or assets for what appears to be improper political activity, for example allowing its property to be used for free by only one political party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-i-attend-an-event-hosted-by-a-charity\"\u003eCan I attend an event hosted by a charity?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Charities may invite candidates to public meetings, for example by inviting them to debate issues on which the charity is campaigning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure they are not encouraging support for any one political party, the charity should  ensure they invite representatives from as wide a political spectrum as possible. This does not mean that all parties have to be represented, however, a charity would have to have very strong reasons for deciding not to invite a mainstream political party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-i-visit-a-charity-during-an-election-campaign\"\u003eCan I visit a charity during an election campaign?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA charity may be open to hosting a visit from a parliamentary candidate at its premises. In doing so, the charity should ensure that its independence is not called into question. Candidates should speak to the charity in advance of the visit and be mindful of the need not to draw the charity into party politics – charities should not to become associated in the minds of the public with a particular candidate or political party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"charities-campaigning-and-political-activity\"\u003eCharities’ campaigning and political activity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-rules-do-charities-have-to-follow-during-a-general-election\"\u003eWhat rules do charities have to follow during a General Election?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCharities can undertake political activity in support of their charitable purposes. Election periods offer great opportunities for charities to raise the political profile of their causes, but charities must be, and must be seen to be, independent from party politics. They must not support or oppose a political party or candidate. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInformation on the role and responsibilities of charity trustees can be found in our helpful \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/political-activity-and-campaigning-by-charities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘5-minute guide’\u003c/a\u003e on political activity and campaigning by charities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCharities should follow the Charity Commission’s guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/speaking-out-guidance-on-campaigning-and-political-activity-by-charities-cc9/speaking-out-guidance-on-campaigning-and-political-activity-by-charities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecampaigning and political activity\u003c/a\u003e and our accompanying guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/speaking-out-guidance-on-campaigning-and-political-activity-by-charities-cc9/charities-elections-and-referendums\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eelections\u003c/a\u003e. Our guidance sits alongside other requirements, such as electoral law, which applies to charities and non-charitable organisations alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"are-charities-allowed-to-support--oppose-specific-policies-put-forward-by-political-parties\"\u003eAre charities allowed to support / oppose specific policies put forward by political parties?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Charities may express their support or opposition to a specific policy advocated by a political party if it relates to their charitable purposes.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a charity whose purpose is to support people’s mental health could support a policy of greater funding of NHS mental health services. But a charity whose purpose is to run an animal sanctuary could not do so because, however worthwhile the cause, it does not relate to the charity’s purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-charities-engage-in-political-campaigning-via-social-media\"\u003eCan charities engage in political campaigning via social media?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Charities can use social media to engage in campaigning and political activity, including on topics that provoke strong emotions – as long as this is a way of achieving their charitable purpose and is in the charity’s best interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCharities should have a social media policy and consider any reputational risks involved. A charity should never be used as a vehicle for the expression of the political views of any individual trustee or staff member. More information is available in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-and-social-media/charities-and-social-media\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esocial media guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-should-i-do-if-i-have-concerns-about-a-charitys-political-campaigning\"\u003eWhat should I do if I have concerns about a charity’s political campaigning?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are made aware of concerns relating to the management or activities of a charity, in the first instance the charity trustees should be alerted to the matter and given an opportunity to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Charity Commission aims to support charities to get it right, but we will take robust action where we see wrongdoing. Members of the public can raise concerns directly via our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://forms.charitycommission.gov.uk/raising-concerns/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-charity-commission\"\u003eAbout the Charity Commission\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Charity Commission is the regulator of charities in England and Wales.

This could be because they regularly move goods under transit or intend to move a specific good using transit. \nFind details of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-and-export-customs-comprehensive-guarantees-ccgs\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewhen a \u003cabbr title=\"Customs Comprehensive Guarantee\"\u003eCCG\u003c/abbr\u003e or individual guarantee could be used\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-your-guarantee-will-cover\"\u003eWhat your guarantee will cover\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransit guarantees differ from some other types of customs guarantees, such as duty deferment guarantees. This is because the guarantee covers a potential debt rather than actual debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the exporter, your customer will not normally be liable to any customs debt.  Instead, any import duties, excise and VAT will be paid for by the importer, so if the transit procedure is followed correctly, no debt should arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA debt will only arise if, after an investigation by the relevant customs authorities:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003egoods that entered transit using the guarantee did not reach their intended destination - were not discharged\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eit is found that customs duties, VAT or excise were due and not paid\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour customer will be asked to settle the debt themselves, but if they do not for any reason then HMRC may make a claim against the guarantee you have issued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen applying to HMRC for a transit guarantee, your customer will need to assess the total amount of potential debt that could arise, at any one time, on the goods they are moving. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-the-amount-of-guarantee-needed-for-common-and-union-transit\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCheck the amount of guarantee needed\u003c/a\u003e.

You must also tell HMRC that you have done so. HMRC will then take reasonable steps to make sure new transit movements are not permitted to start using your guarantee after this date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the guarantee will remain legally enforceable until 16 days after notice is given.  If any new movements are started using your guarantee between the date you tell HMRC and 16 days after that, you would be liable for any claims that are then made against your guarantee for these movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-let-hmrc-know-you-are-ending-your-relationship-with-the-customer\"\u003eHow to let HMRC know you are ending your relationship with the customer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/central-community-transit-office-new-address-cip2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econtact the Central Community Transit Office\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-and-when-you-will-be-told-what-potential-liability-remains-against-that-guarantee\"\u003eHow and when you will be told what potential liability remains against that guarantee\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHMRC has 9 months from the date that the goods should have arrived at the office of destination and been presented to customs to inform the guarantor that the procedure has not been discharged correctly. Movements are normally expected to finish within a maximum of 21 days from leaving the office of departure (that is, the date the transit procedure starts).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will therefore be potentially liable for a debt arising from any movement started within the period of validity of the guarantee, but this potential liability will expire if HMRC have not notified you that you are at risk within 9 months from the expected end date of the movement. The period of validity includes any time before the expiry of the guarantee or 16 days after you tell HMRC that the guarantee has been terminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll potential liabilities will therefore end no later than 9 months from the final expiry of the guarantee if no such notice has been given to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever if HMRC tell you that you are at risk within 9 months, the customs authority where any debt arises must also tell you within 3 years from the date of the movement starting that you may be required to pay a debt and the amount of this debt. If you are not told, your potential liability will expire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you receive both notices within the appropriate time frames, the guarantee will remain in force. You may still be liable to make a payment up to the amount notified to you by the customs authority where the debt arose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will make sure that any legal proceedings associated with that debt are permitted to reach their conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

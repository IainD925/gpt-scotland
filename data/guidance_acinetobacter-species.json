Healthy individuals are at low risk of infection by Acinetobacter species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcinetobacter infections acquired in the community are very rare and most strains found outside hospitals are sensitive to antibiotics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA few species, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, can cause serious infections in hospital patients who are already very unwell. These ‘hospital-adapted’ strains of Acinetobacter baumannii are sometimes resistant to many antibiotics and the infections that they cause can therefore be difficult to treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common Acinetobacter infections include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epneumonia\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebacteraemia (blood stream infection)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewound infections\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eurinary tract infections\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"diagnosis\"\u003eDiagnosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/amrhai-reference-unit-reference-and-diagnostic-services\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAntimicrobial resistance and healthcare associated infections (AMRHAI) reference unit\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"management\"\u003eManagement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acinetobacter-working-party-guidance-on-the-control-of-multi-resistant-acinetobacter-outbreaks\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWorking party guidance on the control of multi-resistant Acinetobacter outbreaks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"epidemiology\"\u003eEpidemiology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acinetobacter-spp-bacteraemia-annual-data-from-voluntary-surveillance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAcinetobacter spp. bacteraemia: annual data from voluntary surveillance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The Forestry Commission may still ‘call in’ projects with this starting presumption as requiring ‘stage 2’ Consent and take enforcement action where necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can, using these starting presumptions, judge for yourself if you want to proceed without a ‘stage 1’ \u003cabbr title=\"Environmental Impact Assessment\"\u003eEIA\u003c/abbr\u003e application and decision. However, you will forgo the certainty of receiving a definitive ‘stage 1’ decision from the Forestry Commission. Doing so risks the Forestry Commission taking enforcement action against you (for instance, by requiring you to restore the land to its previous condition at your own expense).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, you can submit a ‘stage 1’ \u003cabbr title=\"Environmental Impact Assessment\"\u003eEIA\u003c/abbr\u003e application in order to gain certainty on whether Consent is required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe threshold tables are listed below for each project type and size. When considering your proposal’s size, you should factor in any adjacent projects – see the section on \u003ca href=\"#adjacent-projects\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eadjacent projects\u003c/a\u003e. For each land sensitivity, the tables state the risk of not submitting an application. You can decide whether you want to assume this risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a proposal lies across multiple types of land, the most sensitive threshold applies to the whole proposal. For example, where part of the proposal is in a sensitive area, and the other part is not, the whole project should be considered as being within the threshold for that sensitive

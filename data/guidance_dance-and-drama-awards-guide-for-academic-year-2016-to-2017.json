The Self-Declaration of Income form should be used to initially assess the student’s household income to determine an indicative level of support they may be eligible to receive. This form should be completed by the student when a provisional place at the institution has been offered to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a student has formally accepted their place at the institution, they must complete the main DaDA application form to determine the final amount of funding they are eligible to receive.

For the 2016 to 2017 academic year this is the 2015 to 2016 tax year. Income can be evidenced by a Tax Credit Award Notice, receipt of benefits or evidence from employment (P60, P9D, P11D) or self-employment. Unearned income such as shares and investments, savings, pensions and income from rental property should also be taken into account when assessing a student’s application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"tuition-fees\"\u003eTuition fees\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe income assessment undertaken at the start of the student’s course for tuition fees should normally last for the duration of the student’s course. However institutions have the discretion to re-assess fees at the end of the academic year (but not in-year) where the student can provide evidence that there has been a dramatic change of circumstances. Such as, where there has been a long term change which affects their current circumstance or where the change has occurred for the whole of the previous academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn-year reassessment of tuition fee costs can only take place in exceptional cases such as disability or death of a parent or carer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"living-costs-maintenance\"\u003eLiving costs (maintenance)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIncome assessment for funding living costs must be undertaken on an annual basis. Students are required to submit a new application for living costs support each academic year. In-year reassessment of living costs support can only take place in exceptional cases, such as disability or death of a parent or carer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-year-reassessment-independent-students\"\u003eIn-year reassessment independent students\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA student may have their fees and living costs application reassessed in-year if their circumstances change and they can provide evidence that they have become an ‘independent’ student, that is, they can evidence that they are either married; have financially supported themselves for 3 years or more; are the natural or adoptive parent of a child who lives with them; have no living parents; or are estranged from their parents. An independent student reassessment is undertaken on the student’s household income and that of their spouse or partner (if they have one).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"confirmation-of-dada-funding\"\u003eConfirmation of DaDA funding\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the student’s application has been fully assessed and the evidence they have supplied has been checked, institutions should notify students who are eligible for funding in writing to confirm the amount of tuition fees and, any living costs funding they are entitled to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a student is not offered DaDA funding, the institution must write to the student explaining the reasons for this, setting out details of their appeals procedure. If the student believes that the process used to come to this decision contains irregularities, they must be given the right to appeal under the institution’s procedures. If the institution is found to be in error, they must compensate the student appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile written confirmation of DaDA funding should not be given by the institution until the application has been assessed and the evidence checked, institutions may wish to make provisional DaDA funding offers at an earlier stage (see Application, Income Assessment and Payment of DaDA funding section above). Any provisional amount of DaDA funding stated by the institution to the student must be clear that it is on the basis of the information supplied by the student on the self-declaration form judged against the published DaDA income assessment scales. The institution must make clear that the funding amount quoted to them is not guaranteed but is subject to verification and confirmation via the main application form at a later date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"payment-of-dada-funding-to-students\"\u003ePayment of DaDA funding to students\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should make living costs payments directly to students once they have been fully assessed as eligible for DaDA. Institutions are free to determine the frequency of payments to students; however it is recommended that payments are made in instalments, for example, on a termly basis. This will ensure that students do not receive funding that they are not entitled to, if, for example, they withdraw from their course part way through the year. Where an institution issues a large amount of funding to a student, they should be aware that this is at their own risk. No additional funding can be claimed from the EFA in the event of any overpayment to students by institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should make clear to students that continued receipt of DaDA is conditional on them meeting agreed standards set by the institutions, such as, relating to attendance, behaviour and progression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"communications-governance-and-monitoring\"\u003eCommunications, governance and monitoring\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for ensuring that information about DaDA is available to students through their literature and websites and that this information is up to date.

Reconciliation will be undertaken at the end of the academic year.  An in-year reconciliation will also take place in April 2017 if institutions identify a significant amount of unused funding in the in-year MI return.  Full details about the reconciliation process and the MI requirements will be communicated to institutions separately in March 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"audit-and-scheme-protection\"\u003eAudit and scheme protection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdministration and allocation of DaDA is subject to the EFA’s audit process.\nInstitutions should maintain accurate and up to date records of students and funding for audit purposes and to provide accurate management information (MI).  This includes recording students in receipt of DaDA on the budget management spread sheet for the 2016 to 2017 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EFA may withdraw DaDA funding at any time, from any institution that fails to comply with all aspects of this information on GOV.UK, with Health and Safety, Equal Opportunities or any other legal requirements applying to the institution or if it is not able to provide sufficient evidence that it is financially viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDaDA funding may also be withdrawn where the institution fails to meet the qualification requirements of the DaDA scheme, that is, it is no longer validated by Trinity College London as eligible to offer the Level 5 and 6 Diploma qualifications and to maintain levels of quality, relevance to employers’ needs and the standards of performance that are currently set for DaDA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions will be subject to governance and audit regimes which include the requirement for Ofsted inspections and the publication of inspection reports.  They must also permit any person authorised by Ofsted to inspect the institution and afford to such person all the facilities they may reasonably require for making such an inspection as and when required, in line with Ofsted powers of entry and access to documents and its Common Inspection Framework, in accordance with section 131 and 132 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly institutions whose provision is assessed as Outstanding (Grade 1) or Good (Grade 2) at Ofsted inspection will be eligible to offer DaDA funding.

Nationally, there has been a trend of sunburn injuries increasing in the last 10 years. Therefore, improving public awareness of the risks and benefits of sun exposure is very important. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2020, too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation caused around 1.2 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancers and 325,000 malignant melanomas worldwide. Malignant melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK and incidence rates have increased by 32% in the last decade. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nThe global solar UV index is reported on a scale of 1 (low) to 11 (extreme). The higher the index rating is, the greater the potential for skin and eye damage, and the less time is required to cause damage. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nHigh UV levels are not directly associated with hot weather. In Spring, the risk of overexposure may be greater than the risk during summer, because the UV level is often higher than perceived based on temperature. Additionally, if hot spring temperatures occur outside the heatwave alerting period, people are not necessarily aware that high temperatures may pose a risk. This may mean that sun protection messaging occurs too late in the year. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nIn the UK, public information is generally biased towards sun protection, but improving public awareness of solar radiation is also important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

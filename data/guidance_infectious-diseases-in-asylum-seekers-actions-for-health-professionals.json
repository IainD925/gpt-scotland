Diphtheria can initially present with either cutaneous or respiratory symptoms, including sore throat and in severe cases a membrane that can lead to airway obstruction.

Cases are predominantly young males aged 14 to 25 years, with approximately half of cases being cutaneous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA proportion of asylum seekers arriving in the UK are presenting with diffuse and varied skin lesions.

Testing for diphtheria is not universally performed at all local laboratories. Correct labelling of samples, and discussion of severe cases, will ensure laboratories undertake appropriate testing and onwards referral to \u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e reference laboratories where potential toxigenic Corynebacterium species have been isolated. Due to a small number of multi-drug resistant cutaneous diphtheriae isolates associated with this cohort, clinicians are asked to ensure clearance of the organism, from the site it was originally detected. Information regarding antibiotic resistance and appropriate treatment and clearance can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/diphtheria-public-health-control-and-management-in-england-and-wales\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esupplementary guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"antibiotic-sensitivity-testing\"\u003eAntibiotic sensitivity testing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is strongly recommended that local laboratories undertake antimicrobial testing on all C. diphtheriae isolates to include as a minimum sensitivity to penicillin and erythromycin (according to local methods and reported using the (pre-publication) \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eucast.org/fileadmin/src/media/PDFs/EUCAST_files/Breakpoint_tables/C._diphtheriae_and_C._ulcerans_pre-publication_27_October_2022.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEUCAST Clinical Breakpoint Tables v.13.0\u003c/a\u003e). If resistance to either penicillin (R\u0026gt; 1mg/L) or erythromycin (R\u0026gt; 0.06 mg/L) is detected, further antimicrobial susceptibilities are recommended to include amoxicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). If the patient requires parenteral antibiotics, then vancomycin +/- linezolid should ideally be tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMacrolide resistance should be reported to the local \u003cabbr title=\"health protection team\"\u003eHPT\u003c/abbr\u003e, and the isolate should be referred to the \u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e reference laboratory (RVPBRU) for typing and antimicrobial susceptibility confirmation. An Incident Management Team should be convened for these cases to inform treatment/prophylaxis decisions for cases and contacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"skin-lesions-other-than-diphtheria\"\u003eSkin lesions other than diphtheria\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSkin lesions in asylum seekers may be infected or colonised with multiple bacteria; it is not uncommon to see Staphylococcus aureus (+/- \u003cabbr title=\"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\"\u003eMRSA\u003c/abbr\u003e / PVL) and group A Streptococcus co-infection in this group, with on occasion cutaneous diphtheria. Group A Streptococcus remains universally susceptible to penicillin; however, resistance to macrolides, clindamycin and tetracycline antibiotics has more than doubled between 2016 to 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEffective management of skin lesions may require complex antibiotic regimes, prescribed following local microbiology or infectious diseases specialist advice and guided by susceptibility data. Due to migratory routes, and countries of origin, diagnostic differentials may also include rarer pathologies such as Leishmaniasis.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive confines itself to the minimum required in order to achieve those objectives and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe paying agent is the economic operator who pays interest to or secures the payment of interest for the immediate benefit of the beneficial owner.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn defining the notion of interest payment and the paying agent mechanism, reference should be made, where appropriate, to Council Directive 85/611/EEC of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe scope of this Directive should be limited to taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments on debt claims, to the exclusion, inter alia, of the issues relating to the taxation of pension and insurance benefits.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe ultimate aim of bringing about effective taxation of interest payments in the beneficial owner’s Member State of residence for tax purposes can be achieved through the exchange of information concerning interest payments between Member States.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCouncil Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct and indirect taxation already provides a basis for Member States to exchange information for tax purposes on the income covered by this Directive. It should continue to apply to such exchanges of information in addition to this Directive insofar as this Directive does not derogate from it.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe automatic exchange of information between Member States concerning interest payments covered by this Directive makes possible the effective taxation of those payments in the beneficial owner’s Member State of residence for tax purposes in accordance with the national laws of that State. It is therefore necessary to stipulate that Member States which exchange information pursuant to this Directive should not be permitted to rely on the limits to the exchange of information as set out in Article 8 of Directive 77/799/EEC.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn view of structural differences, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg cannot apply the automatic exchange of information at the same time as the other Member States. During a transitional period, given that a withholding tax can ensure a minimum level of effective taxation, especially at a rate increasing progressively to 35 %, these three Member States should apply a withholding tax to the savings income covered by this Directive.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn order to avoid differences in treatment, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg should not be obliged to apply automatic exchange of information before the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Andorra, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Principality of Monaco and the Republic of San Marino ensure effective exchange of information on request concerning payments of interest.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThose Member States should transfer the greater part of their revenue of this withholding tax to the Member State of residence of the beneficial owner of the interest.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThose Member States should provide for a procedure allowing beneficial owners resident for tax purposes in other Member States to avoid the imposition of this withholding tax by authorising their paying agent to report the interest payments or by presenting a certificate issued by the competent authority of their Member State of residence for tax purposes.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe Member State of residence for tax purposes of the beneficial owner should ensure the elimination of any double taxation of the interest payments which might result from the imposition of this withholding tax in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Directive. It should do so by crediting this withholding tax up to the amount of tax due in its territory and by reimbursing to the beneficial owner any excess amount of tax withheld. It may, however, instead of applying this tax credit mechanism, grant a refund of the withholding tax.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn order to avoid market disruption, this Directive should, during the transitional period, not apply to interest payments on certain negotiable debt securities.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThis Directive should not preclude Member States from levying other types of withholding tax than that referred to in this Directive on interest arising in their territories.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSo long as the United States of America, Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and the relevant dependent or associated territories of the Member States do not all apply measures equivalent to, or the same as, those provided for by this Directive, capital flight towards these countries and territories could imperil the attainment of its objectives. Therefore, it is necessary for the Directive to apply from the same date as that on which all these countries and territories apply such measures.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe Commission should report every three years on the operation of this Directive and propose to the Council any amendments that prove necessary in order better to ensure effective taxation of savings income and to remove undesirable distortions of competition.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and principles which are recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"chapter-i-introductory-provisions\"\u003eChapter I: Introductory provisions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"article-1-aim\"\u003eArticle 1: Aim\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe ultimate aim of the Directive is to enable savings income in the form of interest payments made in one Member State to beneficial owners who are individuals resident for tax purposes in another Member State to be made subject to effective taxation in accordance with the laws of the latter Member State.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eMember States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the tasks necessary for the implementation of this Directive are carried out by paying agents established within their territory, irrespective of the place of establishment of the debtor of the debt claim producing the interest.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"article-2-definition-of-beneficial-owner\"\u003eArticle 2: Definition of beneficial owner\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of this Directive, ‘beneficial owner’ means any individual who receives an interest payment or any individual for whom an interest payment is secured, unless he provides evidence that it was not received or secured for his own benefit, that is to say that:\n  * (a) he acts as a paying agent within the meaning of Article 4(1), or\n  * (b) he acts on behalf of a legal person, an entity which is taxed on its profits under the general arrangements for business taxation, an UCITS authorised in accordance with Directive 85/611/EEC or an entity referred to in Article 4(2) of this Directive and, in the last mentioned case, discloses the name and address of that entity to the economic operator making the interest payment and the latter communicates such information to the competent authority of its Member State of establishment, or\n  * (c) he acts on behalf of another individual who is the beneficial owner and discloses to the paying agent the identity of that beneficial owner in accordance with Article 3(2).\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eWhere a paying agent has information suggesting that the individual who receives an interest payment or for whom an interest payment is secured may not be the beneficial owner, and where neither paragraph 1(a) nor 1(b) applies to that individual, it shall take reasonable steps to establish the identity of the beneficial owner in accordance with Article 3(2).

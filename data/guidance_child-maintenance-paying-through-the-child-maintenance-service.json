In child support law the parent who receives child maintenance is known as the ‘parent with care’ - we call them the ‘receiving parent’ – and the parent who pays child maintenance is known as the ‘non-resident parent’ – we call them the ‘paying parent’. In some cases, the receiving person can be a grandparent or guardian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf they live in Scotland, a child aged 12 to 19 and in full-time, non-advanced education or training can apply for child maintenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"get-in-touch\"\u003eGet in touch\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind out \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-maintenance-service/contact\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehow to contact the Child Maintenance Service\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-can-i-make-my-first-child-maintenance-payment\"\u003eHow can I make my first child maintenance payment?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your case is first set up, we’ll ask you to make your first payment straight away.

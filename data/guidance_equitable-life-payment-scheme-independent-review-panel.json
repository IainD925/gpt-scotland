You should complete this form, explaining why you would like your case to be reviewed. On the form you should also quote your “Independent Review Panel: referral number”, which the scheme will have been provided to you with the form. This number is unique to your case and should always be quoted in any correspondence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that the review request form includes all information and arguments that you wish the Review Panel to consider. There is no need to include documents and letters that you have sent to the Equitable Life Payment Scheme as the Review Panel will obtain this information direct from the scheme. If there are any additional documents or information which you have not previously sent to the scheme which you would like the Review Panel to consider, you can send them with a review request form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review request form must be sent to the Review Panel within 1 month of the date it is issued by the scheme. Review Request forms received after this date will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll contact with the panel must be in writing.

The Review Panel will reach a decision as quickly as possible. Normally this will be within 3 months of receipt of your request for a review, although it may take longer if the case is complex, or further evidence is needed, for example if there is a dispute over ownership of the policy. In this case, the Review Panel Secretary will write to you to explain the delay and make any further requests for evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-when-the-panel-makes-a-decision\"\u003eWhat happens when the panel makes a decision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Review Panel has considered all the facts, it will reach a decision. The decision will be sent to you in a letter from the Review Panel Secretary explaining the Review Panel’s reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Review Panel’s decision will also be communicated to the scheme. If a recalculation is required as a result, the Review Panel will inform the scheme and it must act on those instructions. This may result in a change in the value of your payment or payments. The amount you receive may go up or down, or remain the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Review Panel’s decision is final and there is no further appeals process.

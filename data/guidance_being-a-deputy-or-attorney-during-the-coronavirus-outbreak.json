You can find more information about this on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecoronavirus guidance\u003c/a\u003e page. There is specific guidance for \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gov.wales/coronavirus\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWales\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-need-to-stay-at-home-what-can-i-do\"\u003eI need to stay at home, what can I do?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are staying at home, you must continue to make decisions for the person. You cannot ask anyone else to do it for you. However, once you have made the decision you can have someone help with any tasks you cannot do yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need to make a decision but want to talk to the person first, think about how urgent it is and whether it could be delayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"working-with-the-persons-health-or-care-providers\"\u003eWorking with the person’s health or care providers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an attorney or deputy does not mean that you can tell a health or care provider they have to use their resources to help the person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the person is due to get medical treatment such as the COVID-19 booster vaccine, they need to be able to consent to it. If they lack capacity to consent, as attorney or deputy you should make the decision for them if you have the relevant power. The vaccination team should contact you to find out your decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will not have the power to make that decision if you are a property and affairs deputy or an attorney on a property and financial affairs LPA. In that case, the decision about whether the person receives the vaccine is taken by the person administering the vaccination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a health and welfare deputy or an attorney on a health and welfare LPA, then you will likely be involved in that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-i-stop-acting-as-an-attorney-or-deputy-temporarily\"\u003eCan I stop acting as an attorney or deputy temporarily?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you cannot give up your role temporarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re an attorney, you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disclaim-a-lasting-power-of-attorney\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epermanently step down\u003c/a\u003e from (‘disclaim’) your role.

Local planning authorities can take a leading role in promoting a positive vision for these areas, bringing together stakeholders and supporting sustainable economic and employment growth. They need to consider structural changes in the economy, in particular changes in shopping and leisure patterns and formats, the impact these are likely to have on individual town centres, and how the planning tools available to them can support necessary adaptation and change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA wide range of complementary uses can, if suitably located, help to support the vitality of town centres, including residential, employment, office, commercial, leisure/entertainment, healthcare and educational development. The same is true of temporary activities such as ‘pop ups’, which will often benefit from permitted development rights.\nResidential development in particular can play an important role in ensuring the vitality of town centres, giving communities easier access to a range of services. Given their close proximity to transport networks and local shops and services, local authorities may wish to consider locating specialist housing for different groups including \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-for-older-and-disabled-people\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eolder people\u003c/a\u003e within town centres or edge of centre locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvening and night time activities have the potential to increase economic activity within town centres and provide additional employment opportunities. They can allow town centres to diversify and help develop their unique brand and offer services beyond retail. In fostering such activities, local authorities will also need to consider and address any wider impacts in relation to crime, noise and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 001 Reference ID: 2b-001-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-planning-tools-are-available-to-local-planning-authorities-to-help-them-shape-and-support-town-centres\"\u003eWhat planning tools are available to local planning authorities to help them shape and support town centres?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe key way to set out a vision and strategy for town centres is through the development plan and (if needed) supplementary planning documents. Planning policies are expected to define the extent of primary shopping areas. Authorities may, where appropriate, also wish to define primary and secondary retail frontages where their use can be justified in supporting the vitality and viability of particular centres. In addition, a range of other planning tools can help to support town centres to adapt and thrive:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/when-is-permission-required#types-of-area-wide-permission\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLocal Development Orders\u003c/a\u003e can provide additional planning certainty and help to bring forward development as part of a wider strategy to regenerate a town centre.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/neighbourhood-planning--2#what-is-neighbourhood-planning\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNeighbourhood Development Order\u003c/a\u003e can be used in designated neighbourhood areas to grant planning permission for development specified in an Order.

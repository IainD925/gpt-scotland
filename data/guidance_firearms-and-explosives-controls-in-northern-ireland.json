For example, all firearms including shotguns and the more powerful air guns require a firearm certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdministration of firearm licensing is the responsibility of the Chief Constable, through the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s (\u003cabbr title=\"Police Service of Northern Ireland\"\u003ePSNI\u003c/abbr\u003e’s) Firearms and Explosives Branch at Lisnasharragh police station.

The minister with responsibility for law and order, acting on the Secretary of State’s behalf, usually decides appeals.

This ensures that his or her possession of firearms and ammunition is not a danger to public safety or the peace. The Chief Constable will not grant or vary a firearm certificate unless he is satisfied that this is the case and if a firearm certificate holder ceases to meet these criteria the Chief Constable will revoke the firearm certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Firearms (Appeals and Applications) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 specify that a person aggrieved by the Chief Constable’s decision must \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1156046/Firearms_Notice_of_Appeal_form.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esubmit a Notice of Appeal form\u003c/a\u003e within 1 month of receiving notification of that decision unless the Secretary of State is persuaded that there is a special reason to accept it after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn appellant (the person submitting the appeal) may submit whatever evidence he or she thinks relevant. The Secretary of State must consider an appeal on its merits and apply the same statutory criteria, but they are not limited to the same evidence as the Chief Constable and can consider whatever additional information they think appropriate.

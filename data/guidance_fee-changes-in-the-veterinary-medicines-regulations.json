These controls are required to ensure the protection of animal health, public health, and the environment. The VMR also sets out the statutory fees associated with various regulatory services provided by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). The statutory fees and fee structure are changing from 17 May 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe changes to the fees and fee structure are not arbitrary. They are part of our commitment to operating on a ‘cost recovery basis’. This means that the fees we charge for regulatory services under the VMR are intended to cover the costs we incur in providing these services to stakeholders, without seeking to generate a surplus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"fee-changes-to-the-gb-vmr\"\u003eFee changes to the GB VMR\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe change to fees brings several benefits, which includes the introduction of new fees, updating existing fees and simplifying fee structures.

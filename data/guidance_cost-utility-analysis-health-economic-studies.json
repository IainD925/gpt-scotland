The most widely used are generic measures, such as the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://euroqol.org/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e5-dimension EuroQol (EQ-5D)\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form.html\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e36-item Sort Form Survey (SF-36)\u003c/a\u003e. Each measures ask individuals to describe their health across different domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the EQ-5D measure includes 5 dimensions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emobility\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eself-care\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusual activities\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epain or discomfort\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eanxiety or depression\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePatients indicate their own health state by answering how they feel across the different health domains. Each health state is then assigned a value, taken from the general public, to generate an \u003cabbr title=\"health-related quality of life\"\u003eHRQL\u003c/abbr\u003e score. For example, the EQ-5D score uses a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life years\"\u003eQALYs\u003c/abbr\u003e are calculated by multiplying the time spent in a particular health state by the corresponding \u003cabbr title=\"health-related quality of life\"\u003eHRQL\u003c/abbr\u003e score. For instance, if a digital product for managing heart failure extends a person’s life by 5 years at a quality of life by 0.8, compared to an alternative option, then it would generate 4 (5x0.8) \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life years\"\u003eQALYs\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reporting-the-results\"\u003eReporting the results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo summarise the relative cost-effectiveness of your product compared to alternative products, you should report an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (\u003cabbr title=\"incremental cost effectiveness ratio\"\u003eICER\u003c/abbr\u003e). The \u003cabbr title=\"incremental cost effectiveness ratio\"\u003eICER\u003c/abbr\u003e is calculated by taking the ratio between the incremental cost and the incremental \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life year\"\u003eQALY\u003c/abbr\u003e, which gives you the cost per additional \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life year\"\u003eQALY\u003c/abbr\u003e gained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a digital product for managing heart failure generates 4 \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life years\"\u003eQALYs\u003c/abbr\u003e compared to an alternative option. If that digital product costs £4,000 more than the alternative, then the \u003cabbr title=\"incremental cost effectiveness ratio\"\u003eICER\u003c/abbr\u003e would be £4,000 divided by 4, that is £1,000 per \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life year\"\u003eQALY\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis measure is useful to inform resource allocation decisions at national level. It allows a quick assessment of whether a specific product is cost-effective by identifying whether the \u003cabbr title=\"incremental cost effectiveness ratio\"\u003eICER\u003c/abbr\u003e is below the maximum a decision-maker is willing to pay for a \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life year\"\u003eQALY\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the cost per \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life year\"\u003eQALY\u003c/abbr\u003e threshold by \u003cabbr title=\"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\"\u003eNICE\u003c/abbr\u003e for England and Wales is between £20,000 and £30,000. The example digital product for managing heart failure would be judged highly cost-effective because its \u003cabbr title=\"incremental cost effectiveness ratio\"\u003eICER\u003c/abbr\u003e (£1,000 per \u003cabbr title=\"quality-adjusted life year\"\u003eQALY\u003c/abbr\u003e) is well below this threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-the-pas-study\"\u003eExample: the \u003cabbr title=\"Personal Advice in Stopping Smoking\"\u003ePAS\u003c/abbr\u003e study\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Smit and others (2013): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636293/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCost-effectiveness and cost-utility of internet-based computer tailoring for Smoking Cessation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Personal Advice in Stopping Smoking (\u003cabbr title=\"Personal Advice in Stopping Smoking\"\u003ePAS\u003c/abbr\u003e) programme for smoking cessation combined multiple computer tailoring and tailored counselling by a practice nurse.

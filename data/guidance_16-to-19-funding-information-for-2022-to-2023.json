This is on the basis that when the number of hours of education provided to a student increase, not all costs for delivering that student’s education rise in the same proportion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the costs of recruiting and registering students, covering exam fees, and other administration costs plus, other fixed costs, will remain the same. We believe the hours will be deliverable at this marginal rate. We will continue to liaise with the sector to monitor this over the period of the spending review. However, the funding is provided as part of an overall increase in the funding rate and institutions will be able to use this increase flexibly to deliver 16 to 19 education to their students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking into how we will hold providers to account for the delivery of the additional hours and associated funding. This may include funding reconciliation where providers have not delivered the policy. We will discuss our plans with sector representatives early in the new year. We will publish further guidance about this in February before we start to issue 16 to 19 funding allocations for 2022 to 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, there will be extra funding to give greater support to students with high needs.

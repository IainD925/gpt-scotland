It is money the government has given to local authorities, schools, colleges and other education and training providers (institutions) to give to disadvantaged students. Its purpose is to provide financial support to help students overcome specific barriers to participation, so they can remain in education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursaries:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ediscretionary bursaries that institutions award to meet individual needs. For example, transport, meals, books and equipment\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEducation institutions are responsible for managing both types of bursary. Students who want to apply for support from the bursary fund should contact their chosen institution as soon as possible to make an application. There should also be information about applying for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund on institution websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-this-guide-is-for\"\u003eWho this guide is for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is for all institutions that administer the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund. This includes schools, academies, FE colleges, sixth-form colleges, training providers, specialist independent providers and local authorities. Education Funding Agency (EFA) calls all of these ‘institutions’ throughout this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is non-statutory and sets out the arrangements the Secretary of State intends to make under Section 14 of the Education Act 2002. Although the guide is not statutory, we expect institutions to use it as the basis of their bursary policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA guide for young people and their parents is available on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/1619-bursary-fund\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions have questions about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund not answered by this guide, they should contact EFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are enquiring from or regarding an academy\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"contact contact\" id=\"contact_2538\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eESFA enquiries\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n\n        \u003cp class=\"govuk-!-margin-bottom-4\"\u003e\n          Contact form \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json\u0026amp;redirectlink=%2Fen\u0026amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen\u0026amp;consentMessage=yes\"\u003ehttps://form.education...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eFor all enquiries for the Education and Skills Funding Agency\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor other institutions\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"contact contact\" id=\"contact_1832\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp class=\"govuk-!-margin-bottom-4\"\u003e\n          Email \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"mailto:Enquiries.EFA@education.gsi.gov.uk\"\u003eEnquiries.EFA@education.gsi.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"changes-for-the-2015-to-2016-academic-year\"\u003eChanges for the 2015 to 2016 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom late-May 2015 the Learner Support Service will be known as the Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) and will continue to administer the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund for vulnerable students on behalf of EFA.

It will gradually replace Income Support and the Employment and Support Allowance, which are both qualifying benefits for the vulnerable bursary. You may soon start to see students claiming vulnerable bursaries based on receiving UC instead of these benefits. Universal Credit award notifications do not include any information on the benefits they replace, so you will not be able to tell from the document whether a student meets the Income Support or Employment and Support Allowance criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the academic year beginning in September 2016, you should ask any student claiming a vulnerable bursary based on a UC award to tell you which benefit it has replaced, so that you can complete the SBSS claims form correctly. Those who say that their UC award is in place of Employment and Support Allowance must also be receiving Disability Living Allowance or its replacement, Personal Independence Payment. If the student is unsure why they have been awarded UC, treat it as a replacement for Income Support. You should then send the claim to the Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) in the usual way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFunding claims for vulnerable students in the 2015 to 2016 academic year will be made online using the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://studentbursarysupport.education.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSBSS portal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions will be able to submit vulnerable bursary funding claims for the 2015 to 2016 academic year from 1 August 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo reduce bureaucracy, we have decided to stop the annual voluntary MI collection.  Data fields for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund are included in the ILR and the school census, and we encourage all institutions to complete these fields so that we are able to evidence take-up of the bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"managing-the-bursary--responsibilities-of-education-institutions\"\u003eManaging the bursary – responsibilities of education institutions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEducation institutions that receive an allocation of 16 to 19 bursary funding from the EFA have the following responsibilities:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey must have a policy that sets out who is eligible to receive the discretionary bursary in their institution and what the eligibility criteria are\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey must publicise the bursary and their policy so that students are aware of it and how to apply.

Students in one or more of the groups below need more support and can apply for a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200. Institutions do not receive an allocation of funds for vulnerable bursaries.

They should ensure confidentiality to reduce these concerns. For example, institutions should tell students how their information will be used and shared and do not make students identify themselves publicly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can take the initiative to identify students eligible for the vulnerable bursary by working with the local authority, looked after children’s education services and care leaver services, to help and encourage students to apply for a bursary. Institutions and local authorities can also set up local data sharing agreements to share information on which students might be eligible and who should be supported to make an application. For example, institutions might want to ask their local authority if a young person received free school meals in year 11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood practice\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of working with local stakeholders to identify eligible young people:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eone college works with student advisors and the council’s social services team to identify young people in the defined vulnerable groups.

In some cases carers and social workers are involved in establishing the most appropriate way of getting the funding to the young person. At the beginning of term, if specialist equipment and/or a travel pass is needed, this is purchased by the college and the cost is deducted from the student’s overall award. The remainder is paid to the student monthly or termly depending on need. In cases where a carer has responsibility for the young person’s finances, meetings are set up with them to decide how payments should be made.

Every student who qualifies for a vulnerable student bursary is offered an interview with a financial support advisor to decide together on the best way to deliver their support.

Additional expenditure such as university visits is also discussed, and where money remains, an amount is retained for unforeseen costs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003estudents receiving a vulnerable student bursary receive £20 per week via BACS. Additional funds are also given at the start of their course so that students can pay for equipment and course-related items. Those in the vulnerable groups are also offered travel vouchers as part of their payments. The Student Services Team meet with these students regularly to help them with budgeting and to identify any barriers to learning that could be overcome through bursary funds.

Because receipt of the bursary is conditional on meeting the agreed standards, institutions can withhold payments, but they should consider the individual circumstances of the student first. Evidence from the independent evaluation of the bursary indicates that some students have been sanctioned to the extent that their bursary funding for a whole term has been withheld. This is not recommended as it can stop students attending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should consider the impact on attendance that might be caused by illness or other exceptional circumstances. This should be built into the payment conditions agreed between the student and their institution, so that both parties are aware of the possible affect to payments. Institutions should also be aware that payments should be stopped for students who have been absent for a period of four continuous weeks or more (excluding holidays, or if there is evidence of an intention of the student to return). Or for students who have made a decision to withdraw from a study programme. Institutions can take back money from students if they have not spent it for the agreed qualifying reason.

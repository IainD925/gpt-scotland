The same principles apply to focus groups as to interview studies. You will need to create a plan in advance of the focus group session. Think about what you want to find out. You can \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/define-how-your-product-works-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003euse your model of how your product works to help you put together questions to guide the discussion during the focus group\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on what you want to find out, you might want to recruit people who are similar to each other (homogeneous sampling), or recruit more varied users to get a wider understanding of their experience of your digital product (heterogeneous sampling). For example, when developing a fitness tracker for people with physical disabilities, you might want to recruit people with disabilities who have used a tracker before in order to find out their needs and preferences. Then, once the tracker is developed, you might want to recruit people with disabilities who are physically inactive to find out their experiences of the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no set size of the group; 6 to 8 people often works well. Smaller groups can work too. You will need to decide how many focus groups to conduct. One approach is to keep recruiting participants until you are not getting any new insights from focus groups (saturation of answers).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFocus groups need facilitators. They should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eencourage participants to discuss their views openly\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003euse prompts and questions to make sure the discussion points you are interested in are covered\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have not facilitated a focus group before, it is a good idea to get someone to run it for you until you become familiar with the role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to consider:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003evenue – neutral places are best because participants will be more open in what they say\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eduration – 1–2 hours is usual\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erefreshments\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhether you will pay transport costs or give participants incentives for participating\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to spend some time at the beginning of the focus group building trust and rapport. It is also a good practice to have some ground rules, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erespect others’ opinions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elisten without interrupting\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edon’t talk over each other\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emaintain confidentiality – what is said in the room stays in the room.

This would help to spark discussion and debate around the fitness tracking features users wanted and any unmet needs this group of users had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey used an experienced facilitator and an observer who was also taking notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey conducted 4 groups with 15 participants. They stopped at this point because they had reached saturation.\nDuring the focus group session, the facilitator and the note-taker recorded all the fitness tracking features mentioned. At the end of each group session, they compared their notes and compiled the list of features. Each participant was asked to rate the priority of features as ‘must have’, ‘nice to have’ or ‘not needed’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe focus group sessions were recorded and transcribed. The team used thematic analysis, but also focused their analysis to find out more about the features, functionality and appearance of the app that they wanted to develop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe results included the compiled list of 34 recommended features and functions of the app. They also identified five overarching themes around intuitive and accessible design, personalisation of the app, gamification and social features. These were ranked according to their importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote that these results on user preferences might apply to people with physical disability who are active, but they might be quite different for those who are inactive. It is important to think about which users of your digital product you want to focus on. This will dictate your sampling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAvis and others (2015), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.researchprotocols.org/2015/3/e95/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLessons Learned from Using Focus Groups to Refine Digital Interventions\u003c/a\u003e.

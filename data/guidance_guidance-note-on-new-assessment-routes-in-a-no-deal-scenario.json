The \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e decision letter will detail the appeal process and timelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe orphan status will be determined at the time of \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation\"\u003eMA\u003c/abbr\u003e grant. If orphan status is not agreed and company wish to appeal this decision, the grant of a marketing authorisation will only be possible when the appeal process is completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"publication\"\u003ePublication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConclusion of the accelerated assessment will lead to publication of UK-Public Assessment Report for the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-on-the-rolling-review-route\"\u003eGuidance on the Rolling Review route\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rolling Review is a new route for marketing authorisation applications intended to enhance development of novel medicines. It does this by offering on-going regulatory input and feedback enabling the applicants to ‘get it right first time’ and reduce attrition due to avoidable regulatory pitfalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"eligibility\"\u003eEligibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplications for any new active substances including biological products that wish to obtain a marketing authorisation in the UK based on submission of a ‘full dossier’ to \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e are eligible for a rolling review. Similar biological applications (biosimilar products) are also eligible for rolling review. A fee is payable for the evaluation as applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"process-and-sequence\"\u003eProcess and sequence\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process is envisaged as a phased, modular, iterative approach to evaluation of marketing authorisation applications. The details are currently being developed and some early proposals are presented below.\nThe quality, non-clinical and clinical parts may be submitted singly or in combinations depending on the individual circumstances as data becomes available. It is expected that each module will be near completion to avoid multiple iterations of assessment of the same module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach assessment phase will progress independently permitting early identification of issues. Each assessment cycle with points of clarification raised will offer the applicant the opportunity and time for a comprehensive update of the modules prior to final submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final phase will involve submission of a complete application including the remaining module together with updated versions of the modules evaluated previously. Technical validation of the full application will be undertaken prior to commencing the assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with targeted and accelerated assessments, compliance with paediatric requirements are expected to be addressed prior to the final phase. The final assessment is expected to be a single phase with the grant (or refusal in case of unresolved concerns) of the marketing authorisation. The \u003cabbr title=\"Risk Management Plans\"\u003eRMPs\u003c/abbr\u003e will also be part of the final evaluations. Each phase of assessment (for quality, non-clinical and clinical modules) will attract a fee and further information will be provided in advance of the launch of the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnhanced regulatory interaction and advice will be available during the rolling review process supporting the development process and reducing the risk of failure at the final stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"expert-input\"\u003eExpert input\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsultation with expert advisory groups is anticipated at each stage and with \u003cabbr title=\"Commission on Human Medicines\"\u003eCHM\u003c/abbr\u003e and therapy areas experts (Specialty EAGs) prior to grant of full \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation\"\u003eMA\u003c/abbr\u003e. \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e will publish further information on the details of the scheme in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The notice cancels the initial notice, meaning work cannot continue until a new initial notice is in place or the local authority has assumed regulatory responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-role-of-building-control\"\u003e2. What is the role of building control? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding control performs checks to provide assurance that buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the building regulations, which set standards for the design and construction of buildings to ensure the health and safety for people in or around those buildings. This function can be carried out by local authority building control teams, or by private sector companies, known as Registered Building Control Approvers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the responsibility of the person carrying out the work to ensure that the provisions of the regulations are fully met. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-has-happened-to-pwc-building-control-services-ltd\"\u003e3. What has happened to PWC Building Control Services Ltd? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePWC Building Control Services Ltd has entered liquidation, meaning that all their uncompleted projects should have received a cancellation notice. We believe that most of these projects will revert to the relevant local authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-and-why-will-the-local-authority-get-involved-with-my-project\"\u003e4. When and why will the local authority get involved with my project?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding control is a function of local authorities set out in legislation. They have the powers to act should, for whatever reason, an \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e be unable to continue as the inspectors on your project.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePWC have had to cancel initial notices as they are unable to carry out their building control function. In this case, if a new \u003cabbr title=\"Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eRBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e cannot be appointed within 7 days and meet the requirements for this transfer, then the work will revert to the local authority building control. This process is called a reversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information see: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-control-practice-guidance-cancellation-notices-transfers-and-reversions#reversion-of-projects-to-the-local-authority\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBuilding control practice guidance: Cancellation notices, transfers and reversions\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-have-had-a-letter-from-the-airbcas-administrator-can-the-administrator-give-a-final-certificate-or-cancellation-notice-on-behalf-of-my-airbca\"\u003e5. I have had a letter from the \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s administrator. Can the administrator give a final certificate or cancellation notice on behalf of my \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, a legitimate final certificate must be given by an \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e (or a completion certificate must be given by a local authority where they are the building control body). A cancellation notice, however, can be issued by the \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e or by the person carrying out the work (the contractor or the homeowner).   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of PWC Building Control Services Ltd all (or almost all) of their work has received a cancellation notice. This means a final certificate cannot be given (unless a new \u003cabbr title=\"Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eRBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e is appointed) and the local authority will need to provide a completion certificate once they are content that the project complies with the building regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-control-practice-guidance-cancellation-notices-transfers-and-reversions#overview-cancellation-notices\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on when a client must cancel the initial notice\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-when-a-cancellation-notice-has-not-been-issued-by-an-airbca-but-it-appears-to-the-person-carrying-out-or-intending-to-carry-out-the-work-eg-the-client-developer-or-contractor-depending-on-who-is-named-on-the-initial-notice-that-the-airbca-is-no-longer-willing-or-able-to-carry-out-their-functions-with-respect-to-any-of-that-work\"\u003e6. What happens when a cancellation notice has not been issued by an \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e, but it appears to the person carrying out or intending to carry out the work (e.g. the client, developer, or contractor depending on who is named on the initial notice) that the \u003cabbr title=\"Approved Inspector/Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eAI/RBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e is no longer willing or able to carry out their functions with respect to any of that work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis route does not involve a transfer certificate or report, nor does it have a time limit between the issuing of the cancellation notice and the submission of the new initial notice. However, it only applies where the person carrying out (or intending to carry out) the work is the person who has issued the cancellation notice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the person carrying out (or intending to carry out) the work is of the opinion that the \u003cabbr title=\"Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eRBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e is no longer willing or able to carry out their functions with respect to any of that work, they should then issue a cancellation notice to the local authority. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the cancellation notice has been issued, the person intending to carry out the rest of the work can appoint a ‘new’ \u003cabbr title=\"Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eRBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e who can – jointly with the person intending to carry out the work – issue a new initial notice for all the remaining work (that was not included on any final certificate that was issued, where appropriate). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local authority then must decide whether to accept the initial notice – they have 5 working days to reject the submitted initial notice if there are grounds to do so. Once the initial notice is accepted, the new \u003cabbr title=\"Registered Building Control Approver\"\u003eRBCA\u003c/abbr\u003e can carry out the building control functions for the works in the new initial notice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-control-practice-guidance-cancellation-notices-transfers-and-reversions#transfer-of-projects-to-a-new-registered-building-control-approver-without-a-transfer-certificate-or-report\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on transfer of projects to a new registered building control approver (without a transfer certificate or report)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pwc-have-cancelled-my-initial-notice-can-i-appoint-a-new-rbca\"\u003e7.

You will need to follow the process laid out in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/53B\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 53B of the Building Act 1984\u003c/a\u003e. If this is not completed in the 7 days from the cancellation of your initial notice then the work will be automatically reverted to your local authority. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-control-practice-guidance-cancellation-notices-transfers-and-reversions#transfer-of-projects-to-a-new-registered-building-control-approver\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on transfer of projects to a new registered building control approver\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"will-my-projects-safety-still-be-maintained-to-the-highest-standard\"\u003e8. Will my project’s safety still be maintained to the highest standard? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the responsibility of the client (and, where appointed, the principal designer and principal contractor) to ensure building work complies with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including those for noise. Building control’s responsibility is to conduct checks to confirm this compliance \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the final inspection of building work, either a final certificate or a completion certificate, depending on the building control route that is taken, is provided to demonstrate that the inspected work conforms with the building regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-my-responsibility-in-the-instance-of-a-reversion-to-a-local-authority\"\u003e9.

As a client, you may wish to make a request under section 53(4C) for the information about your project held by PWC. This might assist your local authority to regulate your project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2024/110/regulation/22\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRegulation 22 of the Building (Registered Building Control Approvers etc.) (England) Regulations 2024\u003c/a\u003e highlights that, where partly completed work has reverted to the local authority, the local authority may request information from the owner or issue them with a notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"will-this-cost-me-more-as-the-customer\"\u003e10. Will this cost me more as the customer? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough it will vary by local authority, there are likely to be additional costs due to the need for the local authority to carrying out checks on any work that was not completed and given a partial final certificate by PWC Building Control Services Ltd. Potentially, in some cases, this will include needing to reassess the work where information has not been sufficiently provided by PWC Building Control Services Ltd or yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen reverted to a local authority, they will charge a fee for the work reverted to them in accordance with their charging schedule. This fee will be individually assessed based on the size of the project and the amount of time needed to determine compliance with the building regulations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-have-more-specific-questions-based-on-my-project-who-should-i-contact\"\u003e11.

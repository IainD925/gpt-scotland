You can pass on the infection to others, even if you have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. If you have COVID-19 the public health advice is to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. You should follow the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that we all use personal judgement to manage our own risk.

The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSocial distancing in a place of worship is now a personal choice. People are encouraged to respect other attendees and those working who may wish to adopt a more cautious approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral simple and effective personal hygiene behaviours can also reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. These include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewashing your hands with soap and water or using hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eavoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and washing your hands before and after if you do need to touch your face (for example to put on or take off your face covering)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecovering your mouth and nose with disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze, or sneezing into the crook of your elbow (not your hands) if you do not have a tissue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"let-fresh-air-in\"\u003eLet fresh air in\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen worship takes place inside or in other enclosed spaces, consider how the space can be continually well ventilated, before, during and after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLetting fresh air into indoor spaces is important because when a person infected with COVID-19 coughs, talks or breathes, they release droplets and aerosols which can be inhaled by other people.

Once contaminated, touching them can transfer viruses to people’s eyes, nose or mouth. Those responsible for places of worship should facilitate access to hygiene facilities, for example by providing cleaning facilities and hand sanitiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"singing-music-and-performances\"\u003eSinging, music, and performances\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no limits on the number of people who can sing or perform indoors or outdoors. However, some activities generate more particles as people breathe heavily, for example when singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn situations where there is a higher risk of catching or passing on COVID-19, you should be particularly careful to follow the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on keeping yourself and others safe\u003c/a\u003e as we return to normality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"venues\"\u003eVenues\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll places of worship should follow the principles set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eworking safely guidance\u003c/a\u003e.

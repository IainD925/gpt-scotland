The regular payments are calculated as a lump sum per patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"find-out-more-about-capitated-payments-and-how-they-differ-from-some-of-the-current-payment-approaches-in-place-in-this-5-minute-animated-introduction\"\u003eFind out more about capitated payments and how they differ from some of the current payment approaches in place in this 5-minute animated introduction:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://youtu.be/HWQ7nbcsWmk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWhat are capitated payments?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-payment-reform-is-needed\"\u003eWhy payment reform is needed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFive Year Forward View\u003c/a\u003e (\u003cabbr title=\"Five Year Forward View\"\u003e5YFW\u003c/abbr\u003e) proposes a fundamental shift  in the way that healthcare is commissioned and provided to help lead the integration and efficiency of services. The ambition of the \u003cabbr title=\"Five Year Forward View\"\u003e5YFW\u003c/abbr\u003e is to create a system that is more person-centred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently the different services a patient may need could be funded by multiple commissioners each using a different payment approach. Previously, this has acted as a barrier to integrating care. For example, payments for the majority of acute providers promote increased activity while payment for community and mental health providers often fail to reflect the savings to the system these providers can deliver and their positive impact on patient outcomes. As a result, these providers may have a financial incentive to shift the costs of crises towards acute providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIntegrated care models will change the way services are commissioned and provided as well as accessed by patients. The transition to the new care models requires the development of new payment approaches that support them. The integrated care pioneers and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/futurenhs/5yfv-ch3/new-care-models/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003evanguards\u003c/a\u003e are testing different models of integrated care and payment approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe way we pay for healthcare can support different health and care organisations to deliver services in a more integrated way. Capitation is one payment approach with this potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"benefits-of-this-approach\"\u003eBenefits of this approach\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a provider meets the specified needs of the population for less than the capitated payment, the money saved will go back into the local health system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAllowing providers to share this money gives them an added incentive to keep patients in their target population healthy. They are more likely to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eidentify risks\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eintervene early\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003earrange the right treatment for patients, at the right place and the right time to aid patients’ recovery, continued wellness and better management of long-term conditions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy bringing together the payment for the majority (or all) of the care provided to a specified population, capitation also provides a means of realigning financial incentives of the providers involved with delivering outcomes for the whole system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"help-us-refine-and-improve-this-approach\"\u003eHelp us refine and improve this approach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome local health economies have already begun to explore how a capitated payment approach can help support the integration of care and drive improved outcomes for patients. We’ll refine the payment example as we learn more from local health economies that implement these new models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re exploring the use of a capitated budget, we’d like to hear about your experiences.

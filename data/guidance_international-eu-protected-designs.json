The publication of an international registration designating the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e may be deferred for up to 30 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"applying-for-the-uk-registered-design-to-be-deferred\"\u003eApplying for the UK registered design to be deferred\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is currently no framework in UK legislation creating the right to defer publication of a registered design.\nAs a matter of practice, the IPO permits applicants to defer publication of their design by up to 12 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeferment of a UK registered design application claiming the earlier date of a deferred international registration is limited to a maximum of 12-months from the date of UK filing.

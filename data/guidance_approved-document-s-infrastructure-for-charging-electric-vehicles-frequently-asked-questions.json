This means that the requirement for cable routes in parking spaces without charge points is unlikely to apply unless there are over 10 spaces for sole use by that dwelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a block of apartments with communal facilities (eg car park, entrances, stairways, lifts etc), it would be more appropriate to consider the block as the ‘building’ as cable routes would minimise disruption during installation of future charge points. As such the ‘more than 10 spaces’ would relate to the parking spaces for the whole block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe examples below illustrate how the interpretation of “building” will affect different types of housing\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a new detached house has 2 associated parking spaces then 1 charge point will need to be fitted.

The site boundary will be determined at the point of depositing a full plans application/building notice or submitting an initial notice. The parking space will be within the site boundary if, at this point in time, it is located on land that is owned or controlled by the same party that owns or controls the land on which the building is being built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if a single house is being built on a standalone plot then the site boundary is likely to be the boundary of the plot on which the house is located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a development of 10 houses is being built, then the site boundary for each of the houses is likely to be the boundary of the whole development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere parking spaces are separated from the house by land that is under different ownership or control at the time of depositing building regulation plans, the parking spaces would not be considered within the site boundary. Therefore they would not be associated with that building for the purposes of the building regulations. An example of this would be where there is an existing adopted road or footpath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagram 1.1 of Approved Document S provides an example where dwelling 1 and dwelling 2 are standalone plots and not being built as part of the same development.

Regulation 44D(2) states that “the number of electric vehicle charge points that must be installed is the maximum number of electric vehicle charge points that it is possible to install at an average sum of £3,600 or less for the connection cost of each electric vehicle charge point connection”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection cost is defined in Approved Document S as “the cost of upgrades needed to the electricity system in order to accommodate a charge point, excluding the cost of any building work or the cost of the charge point itself.” This connection cost is the extra cost of the incoming electrical supply per electric vehicle charge point connection compared to the cost without electric vehicle charge points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf this average sum is reached, there is still a requirement to install the maximum number of electric vehicle charge points that it is possible to install at an average sum of £3,600 or less for the connection cost of each charge point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, for those parking spaces where you are you are unable to install charge points at a connection cost of £3,600 or less then you will need to provide cable routes that meet the requirements of paragraph 6.7 of the Approved Document S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA housing development consists of 30 semi-detached houses with their own driveways which under these regulations would each require a charge point to be installed. The extra connection cost for the development is £120,000 which averages £4,000 per house. As this average cost exceeds the £3,600 threshold then charge points will not be required for all houses. The developer identifies that the cost of providing charge points to 20 houses would reduce the connection cost to £105,000 which is an average of £3,500 over the 30 houses. This is the maximum number they can install below the £3,600 threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this example the developer will need to provide charge points to 20 of the houses and a cable route to each of the remaining 10 houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"installation-practicalities\"\u003eInstallation practicalities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"do-any-further-regulations-apply-to-the-installation-of-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-apart-from-approved-document-s\"\u003e6. Do any further regulations apply to the installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure apart from Approved Document S?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the requirements of Approved Document S, the installation of charging infrastructure should also comply with all applicable requirements of the Building Regulations. Furthermore, certain product standards regulations and consumer protection standards may also be applicable, including the since introduced: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulations-electric-vehicle-smart-charge-points\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe Electric Vehicles (Smart Charge points) Regulations 2021\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese require all charge points sold in Great Britain for private (domestic or workplace) use to have smart functionality to help manage the increase in electricity demand from the transition to electric vehicles. The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) is responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-a-single-meter-be-used-to-supply-electricity-to-multiple-charge-points-can-a-single-charge-point-serve-multiple-parking-spaces\"\u003e7. Can a single meter be used to supply electricity to multiple charge points? Can a single charge point serve multiple parking spaces?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA meter supplying more than one charge point may be an acceptable way to meet the requirements in certain circumstances, for example communal areas where it may be difficult to connect directly to the meter supplies of multiple dwellings. Furthermore, a single charge point with multiple outlets may serve more than one parking space, as long as each parking space served by the charge point has its own outlet, can be used simultaneously and can meet the minimum requirements of Approved Document S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"where-cable-routes-are-required-is-it-acceptable-to-terminate-these-adjacent-to-street-furniture-eg-lampposts\"\u003e8. Where ‘cable routes’ are required is it acceptable to terminate these adjacent to street furniture (e.g. lampposts)?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny future connection location should meet the requirements of paragraph 6.7 of Approved Documents S to ensure that a compliant charge point can be fitted in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a lamppost or similar is proposed as the future connection location for the charge point, then it should either be metered or capable of being metered for future connection. When assessing whether a lamppost or similar is capable of being metered, consideration should be given to the future ownership, likelihood that permission will be given to connect and suitability for adaption to host a charge point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll cable routes should be laid as straight as possible and with suitable access points, so that cables can be pulled through in future as per paragraph 6.10 of Approved Document S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-building-which-only-has-covered-parking-spaces-is-exempt-from-the-requirement-to-install-charge-points-but-will-instead-need-cable-routes-to-facilitate-future-installation-if-i-choose-to-install-charge-points-rather-than-just-cable-routes-do-the-charge-points-need-to-be-compliant-with-section-6-standards-for-electric-vehicle-charge-points-and-cable-routes-of-the-approved-document\"\u003e9. A building which only has covered parking spaces is exempt from the requirement to install charge points but will instead need cable routes to facilitate future installation. If I choose to install charge points rather than just cable routes, do the charge points need to be compliant with section 6 “Standards for electric vehicle charge points and cable routes” of the Approved Document?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you choose to install charge points in covered parking spaces rather than just cable routes, then you will be going beyond the minimum requirement that is legally required by these regulations. As such, the guidance in section 6 does not apply to these charge points. However, we recommend that charge points outside the scope of the regulations meet the guidance wherever possible. You should note that the charge points will still need to meet other relevant standards including those for electrical safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"other-requirements\"\u003eOther requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"do-diagrams-64-and-65-of-approved-document-s-stipulate-minimum-space-requirements-for-charge-points-installed-under-these-regulations\"\u003e10. Do diagrams 6.4 and 6.5 of Approved Document S stipulate minimum space requirements for charge points installed under these regulations?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, diagrams 6.4 and 6.5 show minimum space requirements for the future connection location of a floor- and wall-mounted charge point. The location will need sufficient space to enable access for both installing and maintaining the charge point and also recharging vehicles with charging inlets in different places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen installing charge points at the point of construction, the charge point should comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph 6.2 of Approved Document S and the location of the charge point should be suitable for use by electric vehicles with charging inlets in different places. Consideration of space requirements should be made when accessible parking spaces are provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

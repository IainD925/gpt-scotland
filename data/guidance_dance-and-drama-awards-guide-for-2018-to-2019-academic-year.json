It is available at a number of high quality private dance and drama institutions in England. The intention is that DaDA will contribute to the costs of studying for talented young people who want to become professional actors and dancers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly students enrolled on the Trinity College London (TCL) Level 5 and 6 Professional Diplomas in Dance, Acting and Musical Theatre are eligible for DaDA funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important criterion in allocating DaDA funding is for institutions to identify students with the most potential to succeed in the profession based on their talent as judged at audition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dada-funding-in-the-2018-to-2019-academic-year\"\u003eDaDA funding in the 2018 to 2019 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"income-assessment\"\u003eIncome assessment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents starting their course in the 2018 to 2019 academic year have their eligibility for DaDA funding determined by the institution. Institutions do this at audition, based on students’ talent and potential to succeed in the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions assess the amount of financial support a student is entitled to based on nationally set income bands. Household income is used to determine the level of financial support for both fees and living costs (maintenance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions will normally use the income assessment undertaken at the beginning of the students’ first academic year on the TCL diploma course to set the amount of tuition fee support for the whole of their course. However, an income assessment must be undertaken each year to establish the amount of living costs support the student is entitled to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are required to undertake income assessments for new starters (for both tuition fees and living costs) and for students who are returning for their second and third year (for living costs only) using the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dance-and-drama-awards-income-scales\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eincome bands\u003c/a\u003e for the 2018 to 2019 academic year.

This includes deciding whether they wish to allocate all the funding, or hold a small contingency fund to respond to issues later in the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA has based 2018 to 2019 academic year DaDA allocations on data on student numbers and spend from the last full year (the 2016 to 2017 academic year). Projected numbers for the 2017 to 2018 academic year have also been factored in.

Institutions cannot carry under-spends forward into future years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn-year reconciliation of funds will take place in December 2018.  Where the October management information return identifies institutions are holding high levels of unspent funds, ESFA will recover some of these funds and make them available for re-distribution to other institutions.  This process, which was revised in the 2016 to 2017 academic year, will ensure that funds are used to support as many talented students as possible.  Institutions should request additional funds by submitting a business case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will send further details about the process, including a business case template for completion, to institutions in November 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs in previous academic years, institutions may use discretion and flexibility in their allocated DaDA funding.  They can do this to provide partial funding for talented students if they have insufficient funds to provide the full support that the student would have been eligible to receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they communicate to students and parents how they are using this flexibility so that their use of DaDA funding is clear and transparent. Institutions must ensure that they only give out partial funding awards after all successful students applying for DaDA have been fully income assessed and the full DaDA funding process has been completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"application-income-assessment-and-payment-of-dada\"\u003eApplication, income assessment and payment of DaDA\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important criterion in allocating DaDA funding is that institutions identify at audition those students with the most potential to succeed in the profession based on their talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen auditioning students, institutions must implement The Code of Practice for Auditions and Interviews produced by the Council for Dance Education and Training (CDET).

Institutions should not offer provisional awards to students prior to 1 March 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can only offer final DaDA awards when the student has formally accepted a place and they have received a completed DaDA application form and carried out a full income assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595252/DaDA_Application_Assessment_Flowchart___new_students.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDaDA application/assessment flowchart – new students\u003c/a\u003e sets out the application and assessment process for funding.

The student should complete this form when they are offered a provisional place at the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may make provisional DaDA funding offers at this stage.  Any provisional amount of DaDA funding stated by the institution to the student must be clearly explained to the student as based on the information they supplied on the self-declaration form.  The institution must make clear that the funding amount quoted to them is not guaranteed but is subject to verification and confirmation via the main DaDA application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a student has formally accepted their place, they must complete the main DaDA application form to determine the final amount of funding they are eligible to receive.

Institutions are free to determine the frequency of payments to students; however, it is recommended that payments are made in instalments, for example, on a termly basis. This ensures students do not receive funding they are not entitled to, if, for example, they withdraw from their course part way through the year. Where an institution issues a large amount of funding to a student, they should be aware that this is at their own risk. No additional funding can be claimed from ESFA in the event of any overpayment to students by institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should make clear to students that continued receipt of DaDA  is conditional on them meeting agreed standards set by the institutions, for example, relating to attendance, behaviour and progression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"disabled-students-allowance-dsa\"\u003eDisabled Students Allowance (DSA)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDSA will be available in the 2018 to 2019 academic year and to apply for support, students must have been assessed as eligible for DaDA support (either for fees only or both fees and living costs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will continue to assess all DSA applications from students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for making payments:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto all suppliers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto Assessment Centres,\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor the purchase of specialist equipment\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor study skills support for students\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor general allowances\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are required to communicate the type and amount of DSA support that has been agreed to students and to maintain records of expenditure for each student to ensure that the agreed maximum amounts are not exceeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"communications-governance-and-monitoring\"\u003eCommunications, governance and monitoring\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for ensuring that information about DaDA is available to students through their literature and websites and that this information is up to date.

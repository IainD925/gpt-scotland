This funding will provide support to families to rebuild their lives and fully integrate into communities. Round 1 of the £1.2 billion Local Authority Housing Fund (LAHF), provides funding for local authorities to obtain accommodation for families with housing needs who have arrived in the UK via Ukrainian and Afghan resettlement and relocation schemes.

For the purpose of calculating thank you payments, £350 payments are available for the first 12 months after a guest’s arrival. This is then uplifted to £500 from month 13 to the guest’s visa expiry date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 1 October 2024, sponsors/hosts of new arrivals are not eligible to receive thank you payments for hosting a close family member who moves into their home in the UK.  This change applies to payment claims taking place from this date, irrespective of visa application dates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClose family members include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea spouse, or civil or unmarried partner;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea parent;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea parent-in-law;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea son or daughter;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea son- or daughter-in-law;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea step-son or daughter;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea sibling; \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea grandparent; or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe spouse, civil partner or unmarried partner of any of these people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose who are already in the UK and move in with a close family member are classified as having left the Homes for Ukraine scheme, rather than a rematch. In these cases, local authorities are not required to carry out the usual HfU safeguarding checks, however statutory duties still apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils should determine whether a close family relationship exists between a sponsor/host and guest before issuing thank you payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils have discretion over what information they use to determine this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe allocate additional funding for these payments through a ringfenced grant, and we expect councils to cover administration costs within the tariff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-payments-to-councils-are-made\"\u003eHow payments to councils are made\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) makes quarterly payments to councils, in arrears. On 30 June 2022 MHCLG made the first payment to councils, to cover the months March to May. On 23 November 2022 MHCLG made the second payment to councils, to cover months June to August. On 16 March 2023, MHCLG made the third payment to councils, to cover the months September to November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePayments are based on the actual number of Homes for Ukraine guests for the tariff and the actual number of ‘thank you’ payments to sponsoring households within each area and are adjusted to account for ratified rematches between local authorities and devolved administrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"reconciliation-process\"\u003eReconciliation process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMHCLG conducts a reconciliation process at the end of each financial year to ensure that councils received their correct entitlement for both the tariff  and ‘thank you’ payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"england-including-two-tier-councils\"\u003eEngland including two-tier councils\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn England, in two tier areas, both districts and counties have access to funds for their relevant duties under the scheme. Having engaged closely with representatives from the sector to determine the most appropriate payment mechanism, funding for both the £5,900 tariff (£10,500 before 1 January 2023) and thank you payments will be provided to upper-tier councils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in two-tier areas it is a condition of the funding that councils must agree a plan locally to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake prompt payments to lower-tier councils in relation to all the services which they provide to guests under the scheme, during the full duration of the scheme, including for services such as homelessness assistance for which lower-tier councils are responsible\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake an immediate payment to lower-tier councils in relation to any upfront costs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"scotland\"\u003eScotland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Scotland, councils receive the £5,900 tariff (£10,500 before 1 January 2023) and ‘thank you’ payments directly from MHCLG, except in cases where the Scottish Government are currently acting as a sponsor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"wales\"\u003eWales\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Wales, the Welsh Government receive the £5,900 (£10,500 before 1 January 2023) payments for local councils from MHCLG and distribute this funding to Welsh councils.

It is critical that this data is accurately captured and reported to MHCLG to enable payments of funding to be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils must use the tariff to meet all of their associated costs (both for providing council services to guests and for administering payments), this includes any discretionary top up to the ‘thank you’ payment. We recognise, however, that a small number of councils may incur additional essential costs above and beyond what could reasonably be regarded as normal expenditure and not available through other mainstream funding mechanisms. We will therefore consider claims for such costs on an exceptional basis only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe ask that any council which may be experiencing unmanageable pressures to contact MHCLG in the first instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

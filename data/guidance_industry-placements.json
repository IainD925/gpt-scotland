We expect most placements will last an average of 350 hours (approximately 50 days) although some will be much longer if required for a particular specialism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can offer industry placements as a block, series of blocks, day release or a mix of these, depending on what works best for you, the training provider and the student. If you are not able to offer the full 315 hours, you can speak to your training provider about sharing part of the placement with another employer. If a placement is across 2 employers, you should share the student’s industry placement objectives template, including their learning goals with both to ensure the opportunities offered by each of the employers are complementary and form a cohesive placement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndustry placements will make up around 20% of the course, with the student spending about 80% of their time in the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is different from an apprenticeship where you typically spend 80% on-the-job and 20% in the classroom. An industry placement is also different from work experience, which is typically much shorter and usually involves a student observing the workplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"responsibilities\"\u003eResponsibilities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmployers’ responsibilities include providing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea safe work environment\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eopportunities for the student to develop their technical skills within your industry\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea line manager to support, supervise and mentor the student\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean induction which includes explaining relevant policies and procedures\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eat the end of the placement, formal feedback on the student’s progress against the agreed learning goals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraining providers are responsible for making sure students are ready for their industry placement.

Any input tax incurred on costs that have a direct and immediate link only to the facility itself is no longer recoverable. If such input tax has previously been recovered because it wasn’t considered to relate to exempt supplies, this should now be restricted unless it falls under the insignificant input tax rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen attributing input tax, it’s the direct and immediate links between costs and taxable or exempt supplies that decide attribution.

In such cases, any input tax incurred on costs that are directly and immediately linked to both the taxable and exempt supplies is residual input tax for the purposes of a partial exemption calculation. This input tax should be restricted on the basis of a partial exemption method, for example one using the proportion of exempt income to total income generated by the sports facility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the taxable element of the supply in such a case clearly has no direct and immediate link to the use of the sporting facility and so doesn’t in any way increase the taxable use of that facility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"effect-on-capital-goods-scheme-calculations\"\u003eEffect on Capital Goods Scheme calculations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the recoverable proportion of residual input tax has been affected, there may also be an effect on \u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e recovered on assets falling within the Capital Goods Scheme (\u003cabbr title=\"Capital Goods Scheme\"\u003eCGS\u003c/abbr\u003e).

For existing claimants, this means that they may need to adjust their claim accordingly. New claimants should not submit their claims without first making sure that their claim is accurate and fully in accordance with the requirements set out in this information sheet. Should a claimant proceed with an existing claim or submit a new claim either of which is subsequently found to be inaccurate, that claimant may be liable to a penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore information can be found at:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-brief-6-2017-vat-treatment-of-sports-facilities-by-local-councils\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRevenue and Customs Brief 6 (2017): \u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e – treatment of sports facilities by local councils\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-700-the-vat-guide\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Notice 700: the \u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Guide\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70045-how-to-correct-vat-errors-and-make-adjustments-or-claims\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Notice 700/45: how to correct \u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e errors and make adjustments or claims\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-749-local-authorities-and-similar-bodies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Notice 749: local authorities and similar bodies\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-742-land-and-property\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Notice 742: land and property\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70145-sport\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Notice 701/45: sport\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7062-capital-goods-scheme\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e Notice 706/2: Capital Goods Scheme\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any queries contact the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Value Added Tax\"\u003eVAT\u003c/abbr\u003e general enquiries helpline\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

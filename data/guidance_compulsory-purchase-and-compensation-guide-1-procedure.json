Compulsory purchase powers can support the delivery of a range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects in the public interest. In doing so, they can help to bring about improvements to social, economic and environmental wellbeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.\tAlthough compulsory purchase powers can help to deliver positive change, the government recognises that it can be upsetting and stressful to discover that land which you own or occupy is to be compulsorily acquired. Furthermore, the law and procedures relating to compulsory purchase are complex, which can be daunting. These plain English guides are intended to help those affected by compulsory purchase by explaining how the system works in simple terms. The guides reflect legislative changes up to and including the Neighbourhood Planning Act 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.\tThis guide, the first of a series of 4, provides an end-to-end overview of the compulsory purchase order (\u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e) process and is aimed at people potentially affected by a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e in England and Wales. It outlines the procedures which acquiring authorities must go through to use their powers and explains what opportunities those affected have to influence the outcome. The guide reflects legislative changes in effect on the date of publication of this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.\tThis series of guides deals primarily with CPOs which follow the procedures set out in the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. Depending on the type of project that is being promoted, compulsory purchase powers may be granted through other legal instruments and there are separate sources of guidance on the procedures for those.

Furthermore, the same statutory rights to compensation apply regardless of which process is used. The procedures for implementing compulsory purchase powers (if approved), which are covered in the section of this guide entitled \u003ca href=\"#link_possession\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePossession and acquisition\u003c/a\u003e, are also applicable to all types of process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.\tIf you think you may be affected by compulsory purchase through a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e, you should read this guide first.

These words and expressions are explained within \u003ca href=\"#link_appendix1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAppendix 1\u003c/a\u003e of each guide. There are also a number of bodies and organisations who may be able to offer their advice if you are affected by compulsory purchase.

The information they contain carries no legal force and does not constitute legal advice. The guides are not a substitute for professional advice. If you think your land may be the subject of compulsory purchase you should seek advice from a suitably experienced property adviser such as a chartered surveyor, an agricultural valuer or a solicitor, who should be able to advise on your rights and also act on your behalf if appropriate.

However, these are effectively ‘in principle’ powers: they do not, by themselves, allow an acquiring authority to purchase specific land compulsorily. To make use of their powers, acquiring authorities need to first make a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e which must be ‘confirmed’ (i.e. approved) by the ‘confirming authority’ who is either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe relevant government minister (the confirmation of CPOs located in Wales is the responsibility of Welsh ministers); or\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ean inspector appointed by the relevant minister to take the decision on their behalf (‘delegated cases’).\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e15.\tThe \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e process is made up of several stages, which are set out in Diagram 1 below.

In certain circumstances, as set out in Schedule 13 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, it may be possible for affected owners to bring forward the date of acquisition by serving a ‘blight notice’ on the acquiring authority. If accepted, the effect of a blight notice is to require the acquiring authority to purchase your land earlier than it was intending to do so. You do not necessarily need to wait until a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e has been confirmed before you can serve a blight notice – it can be served at an earlier stage in some instances.

This is the principle that people whose land is acquired compulsorily (or under the threat of compulsory purchase) should be left neither better nor worse off financially as a result of their land being acquired – being entitled to compensation which is neither more nor less than the value of their loss. As well as compensation for the market value of any land taken, additional compensation may be payable – for example, occupiers of residential properties may also be entitled to a statutory home loss payment. Guidance on compensation entitlement is set out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/compulsory-purchase-system-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguides 2, 3 and 4\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"preliminary-enquiries\"\u003ePreliminary enquiries\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e19.\tA wide range of organisations have compulsory purchase powers, which can be used to help facilitate a variety of different projects.

To determine the extent of the land that is required, the acquiring authority may visit and inspect any land which may be affected by its proposed scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e21.\tAn acquiring authority may consult on its proposals in order to publicise the scheme and to give interested parties (including affected owners and occupiers) an opportunity to provide feedback. It may consult on its proposed scheme more than once, and the proposals may develop over time. As the proposed scheme evolves, the amount of land that is required may change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e22.\tIt is during this preliminary stage that you may first become aware of the prospect of a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e. Clearly, if the acquiring authority makes direct contact, you will be alerted to its intentions. However, if no direct contact is made but you suspect that there are proposals to acquire your land (for example, because it has been identified in a consultation document), you should contact the acquiring authority if you want to find out more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e23.\tIf you do not know who the acquiring authority is, a sensible first step is to contact your local council. It will be able to advise you whether it has any proposals to use its compulsory purchase powers. If it does not, it may be aware of other bodies’ proposals for development which may involve the acquisition of your land.

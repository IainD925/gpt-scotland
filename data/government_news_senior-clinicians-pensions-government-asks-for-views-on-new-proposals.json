We support the introduction of greater flexibilities to allow members of the NHS Pension Scheme to better control the value of their pension growth and we believe this will have a positive impact on NHS service capacity and patient care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThese new proposals helpfully acknowledge that more scheme flexibilities are needed, over and above the previously proposed 50:50 section, to help senior clinicians to manage their pension growth within the pension tax allowances.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe consultation recognises the importance of the work of the Scheme Advisory Board, through which NHS Employers and our trade unions are leading the development of a recommendation on introducing scheme flexibilities for the benefit of all NHS staff. Employers continue to believe the greater scheme flexibilities are needed for all areas of our workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

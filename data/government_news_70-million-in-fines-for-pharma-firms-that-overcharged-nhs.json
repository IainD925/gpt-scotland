Given Pfizer and Flynn were the dominant suppliers of the drug in the UK at the time, the NHS had no choice but to pay the inflated final price for this important anti-epilepsy medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the following 4 years, Pfizer charged prices between 780% and 1,600% higher than previously. The company supplied the drug to Flynn, which then sold the capsules on to wholesalers and pharmacies at a price between 2,300% and 2,600% higher than the prices previously charged by Pfizer. This illegal behaviour led to NHS annual costs for phenytoin capsules increasing from £2 million in 2012 to approximately £50 million the following year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing its original investigation, the CMA previously issued an infringement decision – finding that the companies’ behaviour broke competition law – in December 2016. Pfizer and Flynn challenged this decision at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). The \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-considers-appeal-in-phenytoin-case\"\u003eCAT upheld the CMA’s findings\u003c/a\u003e on market definition and dominance, but set aside its conclusion that the companies’ prices were an unlawful “abuse” of dominance. The CAT referred this matter back to the CMA for further consideration – known as a remittal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CMA and Flynn then appealed to the Court of Appeal. In March 2020, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-court-of-appeal-judgment-in-phenytoin-case\"\u003ethe Court dismissed Flynn’s appeal in its entirety and upheld aspects of the CMA’s appeal\u003c/a\u003e relating to the application of the legal test for unfair pricing. Following this, the CMA decided to re-investigate the matters remitted by the CAT and opened its current investigation in June 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing additional evidence gathering and analysis, the CMA has determined that the companies’ behaviour was an abuse of their dominant positions in their respective markets and that both Pfizer and Flynn charged unfair prices for phenytoin capsules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003ePhenytoin is an essential drug relied on daily by thousands of people throughout the UK to prevent life-threatening epileptic seizures.

The decision concerns the prices that each of Pfizer and Flynn charged for each of those capsule strengths.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe Chapter II prohibition of the Competition Act 1998 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position by one or more undertakings which may affect trade within the UK or a part of it.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CMA may impose a financial penalty on any business found to have infringed the Chapter II prohibition of up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover. In calculating financial penalties, the CMA takes into account a number of factors including seriousness and duration of the infringement(s), turnover in the relevant market and any mitigating and/or aggravating factors.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe financial penalty which the CMA has imposed on Flynn represents 10% of Flynn’s worldwide turnover, which is the statutory maximum that the CMA can impose for an infringement of competition law.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe NHS can rely on the CMA’s infringement decision in a related court claim for damages against the companies concerned. It will be for the court to determine the level of any damages.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAll enquiries from journalists should be directed to the CMA press office by email on \u003ca href=\"mailto:press@cma.gov.uk\"\u003epress@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e or by phone on 020 3738 6460.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAll enquiries from the general public should be directed to the CMA’s General Enquiries team on \u003ca href=\"mailto:general.enquiries@cma.gov.uk\"\u003egeneral.enquiries@cma.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e or 020 3738 6000.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",

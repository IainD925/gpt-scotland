Our inspection and regulation roles are carried out in collaboration with those we inspect, which we refer to collectively as ‘providers’ (of education or care). We want to build effective working relationships right from the start. This guidance sets out what you can expect from Ofsted staff, and what we expect from you, as the basis for our working relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe code of conduct applies to everyone taking part in all inspection and wider regulatory activity across all Ofsted’s remits: early years, education and skills, and social care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we notify you of an inspection or visit, the lead inspector will explain the expectations set out in this guidance and will ask you to read it. They will explain that you should raise any concerns that the inspection team has not acted in accordance with the code as soon as possible. This is in order to resolve issues before the inspection or visit is completed, where possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"expectations-of-inspectors\"\u003eExpectations of inspectors\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that inspectors establish and maintain a positive working relationship with providers, based on our core values of professionalism, courtesy, empathy and respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise that Ofsted visits have the potential to heighten stress. Inspectors should be caring and will take reasonable steps to prevent undue anxiety and to minimise stress during the inspection or regulatory activity. We expect our inspectors to uphold the highest professional standards in their work, to act with integrity and to treat everyone they meet fairly, with respect and with sensitivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn meeting this expectation, inspectors will:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eact in the best interests of children and young people, considering their well-being, and prioritising the safeguarding of children and learners\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etake careful account of the well-being of leaders and staff, maintaining a constructive professional dialogue and adjusting their approach or activity as appropriate and where possible\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecarry out their work with integrity, using their skill, experience and professional development, and referencing and applying the most up-to-date training\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eevaluate objectively, in line with our frameworks, national standards or regulatory requirements; base all evaluations on clear and robust evidence; report honestly and clearly\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edeclare all actual or perceived conflicts of interest and have no real or perceived connection with the provider that could undermine the objectivity of the inspection or regulatory activity\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt all times, we require inspectors to demonstrate Ofsted’s values, act in accordance with our internal policies and procedures on expected standards of behaviour and conduct, and to adhere to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethe Civil Service code\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"expectations-of-providers\"\u003eExpectations of providers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEffective inspection and regulatory activity relies on the integrity and cooperation of providers, as much as on the professionalism and sensitivity of inspectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe expect you to maintain a positive working relationship with inspectors and inspection support staff, and to uphold the highest professional standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn effect, this means all providers should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebe open and transparent during the inspection, providing evidence – or access to evidence – that will enable the inspector to report honestly, fairly and reliably about your provision\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eenable inspectors to observe the typical functioning of the provision, and arrange opportunities for inspectors to meet with children/learners and staff (separately) without a manager or registered person present\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake a private room available for inspectors to discuss inspection evidence and hold confidential discussions, and let inspectors know about any CCTV cameras at the provision\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etell inspectors how to contact any person(s) responsible for leaders’ well-being (the responsible body), so that inspectors can pass on any well-being concerns, where possible, and support for leaders can be sought quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"deferral-requests-and-concerns-about-inspection\"\u003eDeferral requests and concerns about inspection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that we carry out our planned inspections, wherever possible. However, we understand that sometimes there may be reasons why this is not possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLead inspectors will make clear that you can request a deferral and should do so at the earliest opportunity. Once an inspection has started, there may be exceptional circumstances that mean it has to be paused. Inspectors will refer you to our guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edeferring, pausing and gathering additional evidence\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of our work is carried out smoothly and without incident. If concerns do arise, you should raise them with the lead inspector as soon as possible, so they can be resolved quickly. We will record any concerns raised, and actions taken, in the inspection evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring an inspection or event, you may have concerns that cannot be resolved or raised with the lead inspector. In this instance, you should contact Ofsted to speak to a senior leader. Wherever possible, we will try to resolve issues while the inspection is ongoing, but we also have guidance on how you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complain-about-ofsted/complain-about-ofsted-for-events-that-took-place-after-4-april-2024\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecomplain about Ofsted\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"unacceptable-behaviour\"\u003eUnacceptable behaviour\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspections are required by law. Refusing to engage in inspection is not acceptable. Intentionally obstructing an inspector from carrying out their work could amount to an offence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs stated above, we have emphasised the importance of inspectors’ conduct being based on professionalism, courtesy, empathy and respect. We ask for this conduct to be reciprocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will not tolerate any form of unacceptable behaviour, including verbal or physical abuse against our staff or inspectors. We also do not accept behaviour that intimidates or threatens an inspector’s well-being, such as being made to feel at risk, anxious about their safety, or subject to discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there are reports of unacceptable behaviour, we will investigate this. We may take action, such as pausing an inspection, extending it or calling in senior inspector colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

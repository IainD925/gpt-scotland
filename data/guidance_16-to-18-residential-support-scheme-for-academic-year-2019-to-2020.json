Most students supported by RSS tend to live in rural areas and have limited access to a wide range of 16 to 18 further education provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for assessing if a student meets all the eligibility criteria for the scheme, as set out in this guide and using an RSS application form they have developed.  This includes assessing the student against the nationally set household income scales and verifying with ESFA whether each student’s substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification is eligible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions cannot confirm to any student whether they are eligible for RSS, or make any RSS payments, until all the eligibility checks have been completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility-criteria\"\u003eEligibility criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for RSS in the 2019 to 2020 academic year, a student must meet all the criteria:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must be aged 16 or over but under 19 on 31 August 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged 19 or over are eligible for RSS if they are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’) or have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"residency\"\u003eResidency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must meet the residency criteria in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eESFA funding regulations\u003c/a\u003e for post-16 provision.

A household is defined as the student and the adults they live with who are mainly responsible for them.  The household income must be £30,993 or less in the previous tax year for the student to be eligible. For the 2019 to 2020 academic year, this is the 2018 to 2019 tax year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of RSS a student is awarded is based on an income-assessment that uses the following thresholds:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eHousehold income\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eUp to £21,000\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003e£21,000 - £25,704\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003e£25,705 - £30,993\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003e£30,994 and over\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMaximum RSS award (outside London)\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£3,458\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£2,305\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£1,152\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003enil\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMaximum RSS award (inside London)\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£4,079\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£2,685\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003e£1,355\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003enil\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following London Boroughs are eligible for the London weighting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBarking \u0026amp; Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney \u0026amp; City of London, Hammersmith \u0026amp; Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Islington, Kensington \u0026amp; Chelsea, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Newham, Redbridge, Richmond-upon-Thames, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and Westminster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of RSS shown in the table is the maximum available for each income bracket.  Students will be awarded the actual cost of their accommodation if it is less than the maximum. If the study programme lasts for less than one year, the RSS award will be on a proportional basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents cannot receive RSS if they are in receipt of housing benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligible-education-provision\"\u003eEligible education provision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must have a place on a full-time study programme including either a first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 substantial qualification/s. The programme must be directly 16 to 19 funded by ESFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudy programmes delivered by institutions that have a sub-contracting relationship with an ESFA funded institution are not eligible for RSS funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should refer to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eESFA funding regulations\u003c/a\u003e for more detail about programme funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe full Level 2 or full Level 3 substantial qualification should normally be the student’s first qualification at that level. In exceptional circumstances, RSS may be available to students undertaking additional qualifications at the same level they already hold.  For example, if a student:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewishes to study a second Level 2 which is vocational and their first Level 2 was an academic qualification\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eholds a Level 2 qualification but is required by their study programme to study for a further specific Level 2 to access the necessary Level 3 element of the programme\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis planning to enter higher education and a second level 3 qualification is specified as part of the entry requirement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the institution’s responsibility to determine where exceptions to the first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 substantial qualification criteria are appropriate. Any support must be a genuine exception and ESFA does not expect RSS to be used for this purpose on a routine basis. Institutions should refer to ESFA if they have any doubts about individual cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"substantial-qualification-which-is-not-available-within-reasonable-daily-travelling-distance\"\u003eSubstantial qualification which is not available within reasonable daily travelling distance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for RSS, a student must not be able to access the same or similar substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification within reasonable daily travelling distance of their home address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe substantial ESFA funded qualification is key for RSS eligibility. The study programme as a whole, or the combination of different modules within it, is not considered as part of the assessment of eligibility.  If a student can access the same or similar substantial qualification within daily travelling distance of their home, they will not be eligible for RSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA defines reasonable daily travelling distance as a daily return journey that takes 2 hours or less on public transport; or a distance of under 15 miles from the student’s home or term-time lodgings to the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"application-process\"\u003eApplication process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents apply for RSS directly from their chosen institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions have their own application forms that students complete to seek RSS funding.  All application forms used by institutions must include all the information required to assess if students meet the eligibility requirements for the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important for audit purposes that the student and responsible adult(s) sign and date the RSS application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should ensure they obtain evidence of the student’s term time accommodation arrangements, for example, a copy of the student’s tenancy agreement. The tenancy agreement (or other evidence accepted by the institution) must have been agreed and signed by the student.  It must include the following information:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe student’s name\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe student’s term time address\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe dates of the tenancy\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe cost of the rent\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe landlord’s name, address and signature (please note: the landlord cannot be related to the student)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe student’s term time lodgings must be no further than 15 miles from campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must not release any RSS payments until all the required information and evidence has been provided and they have fully assessed the application.  This includes obtaining confirmation from ESFA that the student’s substantial qualification is eligible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must make payments directly to eligible students’ landlords for their rental costs. Proof of payment should be kept for audit purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should not make RSS payments to students.  The only exception to this rule is in circumstances where a student has already paid some of their rent before the institution has completed assessment of their RSS application.  In this instance, institutions may reimburse these costs, as long as the rental period the student has paid for is within the agreed period of the RSS award.  Institutions must keep proof of payment for audit purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must apply for RSS each academic year they need support from the scheme. Institutions should check that students continue to meet all the criteria for support each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf students apply for RSS part way through the year, the institution can only award RSS from the beginning of the term in which the student applied\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"verification-of-the-students-substantial-qualification\"\u003eVerification of the student’s substantial qualification\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the RSS application process, institutions must complete a course verification form to ask ESFA to verify each student’s substantial qualification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may send one form for all new students seeking RSS funding for verification or separate forms to verify individuals.  ESFA asks institutions to submit course verification forms as soon as possible in the academic year.  This ensures students do not make financial commitments on the assumption they will receive RSS when they may not be entitled to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will send the 2019 to 2020 academic year course verification form to institutions with RSS allocations in April 2019. It is also available on request from ESFA (by e-mailing: enquiries.EFA@education.gov.uk)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must complete the verification form in full, providing all the requested information and noting the guidance included in the form.  Any forms that are sent with missing or inaccurate information (for example, incorrect qualification reference numbers) will be returned to the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must not include any personal details for students (such as name or date of birth) on the form.  ESFA will delete any forms that include personal details and ask the institution to re-submit it containing only the required information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will verify if the same or similar substantial Level 2 or 3 qualification is available within daily travelling distance of the student’s home address. In other words, whether the student can achieve the same or similar qualification in their local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will notify institutions of the decision within 7 working days.  The decision will be either to confirm the student is eligible (the institution will need to verify they meet all other RSS criteria) or to reject the application because the student can achieve the same or similar qualification locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf ESFA rejects an application because the same or similar substantial qualification is available within daily travelling distance, the institution must reject the student’s overall RSS application\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must keep a copy of ESFA’s response as part of their auditable records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder no circumstances should institutions give any guarantees of RSS funding to students, or their parents, or make any RSS payments before ESFA has confirmed in writing that the student’s substantial qualification meets the eligibility criterion and the institution itself has fully assessed the student against all other criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"change-of-study-programme-or-withdrawals\"\u003eChange of study programme or withdrawals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the student leaves the study programme, institutions should stop RSS payments immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the student transfers to a different study programme with a different substantial qualification, the institution must submit a further course verification form to ESFA for the new qualification’s eligibility to be verified.  If the student can access the new qualification in their local area, they will stop being eligible for RSS and payments should cease immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"continuing-students\"\u003eContinuing students\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents in receipt of RSS who are returning to the second or subsequent year of their study programme in the 2019 to 2020 academic year do not need to have their substantial qualification checked with ESFA again.  However, Institutions must confirm, via an application from the student, that students continue to meet all other RSS criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny student who changes their substantial qualification in a subsequent year of study must have their new qualification verified by ESFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"funding-and-allocations\"\u003eFunding and allocations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA has generated RSS allocations in the 2019 to 2020 academic year for institutions that had students verified as eligible for support from the scheme in the 2018 to 2019 academic year where those students are expected to return for a second or subsequent year of study.  ESFA used the course verification form as the source of this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe allocation provides funding for the actual students currently receiving RSS.  It does not make any assumptions about demand in the 2019 to 2020 academic year.  ESFA will release any additional funding that is needed to institutions (both those given an initial allocation and any institution that approaches us in-year with eligible students) as and when required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use up to 5% of their RSS allocation for administrative costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are not permitted to transfer any funds to or from RSS and other student financial support schemes provided by ESFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRSS funding will be reconciled by ESFA at the end of the academic year.  Unspent funds will be recovered and cannot be carried forward to future years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"payments\"\u003ePayments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRSS allocations will be paid to institutions in 2 parts: two thirds in August and one third in April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"individualised-learner-record-and-management-information-requirements\"\u003eIndividualised Learner Record and management information requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA reminds institutions about the importance of completing the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) to indicate the numbers of students getting residential support from RSS.  In the longer term, ESFA will use data from the ILR (Learner Funding and Monitoring (FAM), learner support reason) to identify students who have taken up RSS to generate allocations. Institutions are strongly encouraged to complete these fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will review ILR data periodically throughout the year including R14. This information will support the development of RSS policy and help target RSS funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA requires institutions to complete a short management information return after the end of the academic year to confirm the number of students who received RSS and the amount of funding spent during the year. ESFA will reconcile RSS funds once this data has been analysed.  We will write to institutions to confirm the amount of reconciliation and the date the action will be taken.  Institutions who fail to complete the return by the deadline may be subject to recovery of RSS funds in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"audit-and-assurance\"\u003eAudit and assurance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRSS is subject to normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions must ensure they have appropriate processes in place to record RSS applications and awards (including the students supported, the value of the award and a brief justification for the decision to award funding or reject the application).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they can evidence their application process, how the student was assessed, how they made the decision to award the specific amount of RSS and the funds that they have issued for the student’s costs. They should also ensure they have retained a copy of ESFA’s decision on the course verification form.  Auditors will be looking for evidence that institutions have applied the RSS eligibility criteria correctly and used a consistent application and assessment process for all students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should retain copies of any documents the student has signed to give formal agreement to their conditions for payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHard or scanned copies of documentation should be retained for 6 years (records can be kept electronically).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should note that, following an audit, ESFA may recover funding where RSS payments are found not to have been made in accordance with this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"institutions-responsibilities-in-managing-complaints-or-appeals\"\u003eInstitutions’ responsibilities in managing complaints or appeals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny student or parent who is unhappy with how an institution has handled their application for RSS should follow the institution’s own complaints procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should explain to students how they can complain or appeal about any decision relating to RSS support and/or the way in which their application for RSS support was handled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information-and-questions\"\u003eFurther information and questions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions who would like further information about RSS should contact ESFA via our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/fillform.php?self=1\u0026amp;form_id=HR41uA2F8Dh\u0026amp;type=form\u0026amp;ShowMsg=1\u0026amp;form_name=Knowledge+centre+enquiry+form\u0026amp;noRegister=false\u0026amp;ret=%2Fmodule%2Fservices\u0026amp;noLoginPrompt=1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eonline enquiry form\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

This entails the person fully co-operating from an early stage and subsequently preparing a disclosure report detailing the nature of the irregularities and quantifying the arrears, which we will then verify. Any penalty imposed where there has been full co-operation would not exceed 20% of the tax evaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-penalties-are-worked-out-under-this-approach\"\u003e5.2 How penalties are worked out under this approach\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReductions from the 100% penalty figure will normally be made, to the maximum percentages specified, as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) up to 40% - early and truthful explanation as to why the arrears arose and the true extent of them\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) up to 40% - fully embracing and meeting responsibilities under this approach by, for example, supplying information promptly, including full written disclosure, attending meetings and answering questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese may be aggregated - in most cases, therefore, the maximum reduction obtainable will be 80% of the tax under declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-happens-if-this-approach-isnt-used-to-investigate-your-case\"\u003e5.3 What happens if this approach isn’t used to investigate your case\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a case where this approach is not being used, we will normally undertake the investigation using the full civil evasion procedure under the terms of this Notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, where you co-operate in the same way and to the same extent as required by this approach, we will use the same criteria for a reduction to the penalty as that used for the new approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-rights-and-obligations\"\u003eYour rights and obligations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/your-charter\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eYour Charter\u003c/a\u003e to find out what you can expect from \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e and what we expect from you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"help-us-improve-this-notice\"\u003eHelp us improve this notice\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any feedback about this notice please email: \u003ca href=\"mailto:customerexperience.indirecttaxes@hmrc.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecustomerexperience.indirecttaxes@hmrc.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll need to include the full title of this notice.

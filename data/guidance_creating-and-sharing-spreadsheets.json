For example, you might publish a template form for users to complete and return so they can claim back expenses. In most cases, a spreadsheet is a suitable format for these users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, spreadsheets might not be suitable for technical users who want to perform detailed analysis on the information or combine it with other data. These users typically need data in machine-readable formats which they can use with programming tools with minimal data manipulation. In these cases, it might be more appropriate to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-csv-file-format\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epublish your data as a CSV file\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"use-a-cover-page\"\u003eUse a cover page\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding a cover page to your spreadsheet helps users understand its purpose and content. This is particularly important for large or complex spreadsheets.

Check the specifications of your software, particularly around row and column limits, to make sure you are using an appropriate tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, older versions of Microsoft Excel (97-2003) have a row limit of around 65,000 rows.

Using an open format for your spreadsheet makes it easier for people to use with different tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOpen data formats can also make it easier for your organisation to meet legal or compliance obligations. For example, when responding to requests for information under the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\u003c/a\u003e or the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/data-protection\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eData Protection Act 2018\u003c/a\u003e you might need to provide data in a reusable, machine-readable format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe open file format for spreadsheets is Open Document Spreadsheet (ODS). Most spreadsheet software allows you to save or export as an ODS file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead the guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/sharing-or-collaborating-with-government-documents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esharing or collaborating with government documents\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"use-descriptive-names\"\u003eUse descriptive names\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive your spreadsheet tabs unique names to provide context on the information each tab contains.

For example, use ‘start_date_time’ and ‘end_date_time’ rather than ‘start_date_time’ and ‘enddtTime’ in the same file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your spreadsheet uses multiple tabs, and the columns in these tabs hold similar or identical data, use the same column names. For example, use ‘department_name’ in all tabs rather than ‘department_name’ in some and ‘name_of_department’ in others. This will make it easier to cross reference, manipulate or merge columns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"check-for-personal-information\"\u003eCheck for personal information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpreadsheets can contain sensitive or personal information such as names, addresses and health or financial data. Protecting personal information is a legal obligation and important for maintaining credibility and the trust of users.

Before publishing or sharing spreadsheets, you must unhide all tabs, columns and rows and delete any personal or sensitive information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be certain you are not including hidden data, export the spreadsheet to CSV as this will export all the information from the current tab, including hidden rows or columns. You can then import this data into a new spreadsheet to make sure there is no hidden data in the file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpreadsheet tools can also store personal information in the document properties (the metadata), such as the name of the document creator. This is useful for internal documents but you might want to remove this information for a public facing document.

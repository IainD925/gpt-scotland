At the start of the inspection (usually during the preparatory conversations), the lead inspector will explain these expectations and will ask schools to read the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspectors will uphold the highest professional standards in their work. They will treat everyone they meet during inspections fairly and with the respect and sensitivity they deserve.

For example, if pupils return to school on a Wednesday, an inspection can take place as early as the following Wednesday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA school can request to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edefer or cancel an inspection\u003c/a\u003e, but only in exceptional circumstances. If pupils are receiving education in the school, an inspection will usually go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow often we inspect a school normally depends on the findings of its previous inspection, as outlined below. However, the situation is currently a bit more complicated, for several reasons, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe pause to inspections during the pandemic meant that we have extended the inspection window for many schools\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe government lifted the inspection exemption for outstanding schools; this added 3,000 schools to our schedule, many of which have not been inspected for a decade or more\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe government has also asked us to inspect every school at least once before August 2025\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that the gaps between inspections may be different for your school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe inspect schools under \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/5\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 5\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/8\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 8\u003c/a\u003e of the Education Act 2005 (as amended).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"new-schools\"\u003eNew schools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe usually inspect all new schools, including academies, in the first 3 years after they open. This normally happens in the school’s third year. New schools that opened before September 2020 and that have not had their first inspection can expect to be inspected by their fifth year of operation. This is due to the suspension of routine inspection activity as a result of COVID-19.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/selecting-new-schools-for-inspection\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on how we select new schools for inspection\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"schools-judged-good-or-outstanding-for-overall-effectiveness-before-september-2024\"\u003eSchools judged good or outstanding for overall effectiveness before September 2024\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUntil September 2024, graded inspections of schools included an overall effectiveness grade in addition to the key judgements and any provision judgements. Overall effectiveness grades given before September 2024 will continue to be visible on school inspection reports and on Ofsted’s website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom September 2024, graded inspections will not include an overall effectiveness grade. Schools inspected from then will not have the same way of working out when to expect their next inspection as other schools. We will set out the expected dates for when we will next inspect these schools from September 2025. They should not expect to receive an ungraded or graded inspection before then. Some could receive an urgent or monitoring inspection, which can be deemed a graded inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA school judged good or outstanding for overall effectiveness at its most recent inspection before September 2024 will normally receive an inspection approximately every 4 years. This is to confirm that the school has taken effective action to maintain the standards identified at the previous inspection. We call this an ungraded inspection, and it is carried out under section 8 of the Education Act 2005. We do not give graded key or provision judgements on an ungraded inspection. However, if we find some evidence that a school’s work has improved significantly, or that it may not be as strong as it was at the last inspection, we will carry out a full inspection with graded judgements. We call this a graded inspection, and it is carried out under section 5 of the Education Act. Usually this is within 1 to 2 years of the date of the ungraded inspection, but if we have serious concerns about a school, for example in relation to safeguarding, we will deem the ungraded inspection a graded inspection immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, some schools judged good or outstanding for overall effectiveness before September 2024 will automatically receive a graded inspection. We use a risk assessment process to ensure that our approach to inspection is proportionate, in order to focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"schools-judged-outstanding-for-overall-effectiveness-before-september-2024-that-were-formerly-exempt-from-routine-inspections\"\u003eSchools judged outstanding for overall effectiveness before September 2024 that were formerly exempt from routine inspections\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 15 May 2012 and 13 November 2020, maintained primary and secondary schools and academies judged to be outstanding in their overall effectiveness at their most recent graded inspection were exempt from routine inspections. These schools are now once again subject to routine inspections. This also applies to academy converter schools that were formerly exempt because the overall effectiveness of the predecessor school was outstanding at its most recent graded inspection. (Academy converter schools are schools that have been approved by the Secretary of State to convert to become an academy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll formerly exempt schools will receive an initial graded or ungraded inspection by July 2025. Those schools that received their last graded inspection before September 2015 will receive an initial graded inspection. Those that received their last graded inspection after this date will normally receive an initial ungraded inspection. If that ungraded inspection indicates that aspects of the school’s work may not be as strong as at the time of the previous inspection, we will normally carry out a graded inspection within the next 12 months or as soon as possible after that. In all cases, this will be before 1 August 2026.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"schools-judged-requires-improvement-for-overall-effectiveness-before-september-2024\"\u003eSchools judged requires improvement for overall effectiveness before September 2024\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA school judged as requires improvement for overall effectiveness at its last inspection before September 2024 will usually receive a graded inspection again within 2.5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom September 2024, if a school meets our threshold for monitoring (as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eschool inspection handbook\u003c/a\u003e) it will be eligible for routine monitoring from inspectors to check its progress.

This means that we judge the school either to have serious weaknesses or to require special measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State for Education will issue an academy order to a maintained school judged inadequate and placed in a category of concern. The school will then become a sponsored academy. We will not usually monitor the school unless there are safeguarding concerns or there is a delay in the school becoming a sponsored academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an academy is placed in a category of concern, we will monitor it. If an academy is subsequently rebrokered to a new multi-academy trust to become a new sponsored academy, we will not usually carry out any monitoring inspections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an academy is judged as having serious weaknesses or requiring special measures, and if it is not rebrokered to a new multi-academy trust, we will monitor the school to check its progress. We will then carry out a graded inspection within 2.5 years of the publication of the academy’s previous graded inspection report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a maintained nursery school or a non-maintained special school is placed in a category of concern, we will monitor it in the same way as an academy that is in a category of concern and that is not re-brokered to a new sponsor trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-inspects-schools\"\u003eWho inspects schools?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSchool inspectors are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eHis Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) employed directly by Ofsted\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003econtracted Ofsted Inspectors\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"notice-of-an-inspection\"\u003eNotice of an inspection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will contact the school by telephone to announce a graded or ungraded inspection after 9.30am on a Monday morning. We may notify schools of an urgent or monitoring inspection on any day. If we have notified a school of an inspection that is subsequently deferred, we can notify that school of the new inspection date on any day of the week. If a school is open in a week that includes a bank holiday, we may notify the school on the Tuesday of that week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy exception, we can inspect any school without notice, if this is judged appropriate. Where this is the case, the lead inspector will normally telephone the school about 15 minutes before arriving on site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we have informed the school of the inspection, the lead inspector will contact the school and ask to speak to the headteacher. This conversation with the headteacher will have 2 elements:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea short inspection-planning conversation that focuses on practical and logistical arrangements\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea longer, reflective, educationally focused conversation about the school’s progress since the last inspection, including how COVID-19 has affected this\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe understand that there is a great deal of information to be discussed at this stage of the inspection. For this reason, it may be helpful to discuss these elements in 2 or more separate conversations with a break in between. The lead inspector will discuss what will work best for the headteacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe inspection-planning conversation will be short and focused on practical issues. This is an opportunity for the headteacher to provide a fuller context of the school that may not be expressed sufficiently through data alone. It is also an opportunity for the headteacher to discuss the particular circumstances of the school that have had a role in the decisions made by leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of this conversation, the lead inspector will also ask the headteacher to inform inspectors about any requests for adaptations to the inspection process because of a protected characteristic, or any reasonable adjustments because of a disability. They will also make the school aware of the help and support for headteacher and staff well-being that is available through the charity \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.educationsupport.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEducation Support\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe educationally focused conversation will normally last around 90 minutes but may be longer. It will help the lead inspector and headteacher to establish a constructive professional relationship for the inspection and give them a shared understanding of the starting point of the inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lead inspector will encourage the headteacher to have at least one other senior leader present during both calls, to assist and support them. This will usually be colleagues who typically deputise for them (or a member of trust staff) and who can understand and discuss the educational content of the calls. They may also wish to have someone present to take notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"before-the-inspection-begins\"\u003eBefore the inspection begins\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe provide schools with a letter to tell all parents of pupils at the school about the inspection and options for providing their views.

The number of inspectors on the inspection team will vary according to the size and nature of the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspectors will spend most of their time observing lessons and gathering evidence to inform their judgements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspectors will talk to a range of pupils and staff about important aspects of the school’s work. Staff (including leaders at all levels) may always be accompanied by another appropriate person when speaking to inspectors. However, it is important that staff are able to express their views freely to inspectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspectors should take careful account of the well-being of leaders and staff and adjust their approach or activity, as appropriate, as they go about their inspection work in the best interests of pupils. If inspectors see or suspect that a staff member (including leaders and the headteacher) is upset or distressed at any point during the inspection, inspectors should respond sensitively. Where appropriate, inspectors will consider suitable adjustments to enable the staff member to continue. Where there are serious concerns, inspectors will contact the duty desk, and will normally inform those responsible for the person’s well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be exceptional occasions when a pause to inspection needs to be considered.

Other updates have been made regarding ungraded inspections, notification periods and to reflect a new policy on suspending inspections to allow a school to resolve issues with safeguarding. Updates have also been made to how schools are placed in a category of concern, our monitoring processes for schools falling below Ofsted’s monitoring threshold, and to reflect the removal of early monitoring inspections from the school monitoring handbook.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Leaflet for schools’ pdf has also been updated to reflect that we are not planning to conduct any aligned inspections of boarding and residential special schools in the 2024/25 academic year, except in exceptional circumstances. In addition, when aligned inspections resume from September 2025, they will not apply to ungraded inspections.",

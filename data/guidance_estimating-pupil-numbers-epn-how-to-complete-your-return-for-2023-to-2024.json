This form replaces the revenue funding data collection (RFDC) form used in previous years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003ePlease submit your form by 5:00pm on Friday, 21 October 2022. Your final budgets may be delayed if we do not receive your pupil number estimates by the deadline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor multi-academy trusts (MATs), a return is required for each estimate funded academy in your trust. Once logged into the form, you will be able to see details for all academies within your trust that are in scope of this process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"moderation-of-estimated-pupil-numbers\"\u003eModeration of estimated pupil numbers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will review all estimated pupil numbers to ensure they are reasonable and well-evidenced. We will consider the October 2022 school census return, trends in pupil numbers, retention rates, the accuracy of previous estimates and any information you provide. If we have not accepted your figures, we will explain why, and institutions will be given the opportunity to provide further evidence to support their estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere necessary, we will contact institutions in early December 2022 to request additional evidence. Following this, there will be a further moderation before final outcomes are confirmed in late January 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pupil-number-adjustments-pna\"\u003ePupil number adjustments (PNA)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInaccurate estimates can cause significant and problematic adjustments to funding allocations. Each year we reconcile estimates with actual pupil numbers, through the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funded-on-estimates\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePNA\u003c/a\u003e exercise. Where this adjustment is positive (for instance, where funded numbers are less than those recorded in the census) it is made in the same academic year. Where funded numbers are higher than those recorded in the census, we will recover funds in the 2024 to 2025 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"trusts-that-have-met-the-conditions-in-their-funding-agreement-to-move-to-census-funding\"\u003eTrusts that have met the conditions in their funding agreement to move to census funding\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be that the basis of funding for your academy will change to the census for 2023 to 2024. This is because, for most estimate funded institutions, determining the pupil number basis for funding requires certain conditions to be met. These conditions are set out in the funding agreement and, in most cases, relate to occupancy levels and/or that there are pupils in all expected year groups. We will use the autumn 2022 census to establish if these conditions have been met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the conditions have been met, the academy will move onto the lagged basis of funding methodology which will use the autumn 2022 census to determine the pupil numbers in the general annual grant (GAG) allocation. There is no pupil number adjustment with the lagged methodology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to the EPN process taking place, we do not have the census data to determine whether your basis of funding will be census or estimates. It is, therefore, important that you provide your pupils estimate now as it would be too late to request estimates in time to inform this funding allocation round, after the census has taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be some institutions that will move to lagged census funding after providing estimated pupil numbers via the EPN. We will confirm whether the basis for funding will be lagged or estimates for all academies within your trust that have these clauses, in December 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2

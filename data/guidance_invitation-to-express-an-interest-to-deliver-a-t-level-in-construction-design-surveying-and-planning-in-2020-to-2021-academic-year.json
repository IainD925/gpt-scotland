This included the introduction of a new framework of 15 technical routes to skilled employment for 16 to 19 year olds, which are either classroom-based (T Levels) or work-based (apprenticeships). Eleven of these routes will be delivered as classroom or workshop based programmes called T Levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/650969/T_level_Action_Plan.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eT Level action plan\u003c/a\u003e, published on 11 October 2017, the government set out the implementation timetable and made clear its intention for the first teaching of T Levels from 3 of the routes by a small number of providers to commence delivery from September 2020, when all routes will be available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial 3 classroom based T Levels will be available from the Digital, Construction, and Education and Childcare routes. Specific T Levels from each of these 3 routes have been chosen for delivery in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, these are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDigital route; Software applications design and development\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConstruction route; Construction: design, surveying and planning\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEducation and Childcare route; Education\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIntroducing the first T Levels in the 2020 to 2021 academic year gives us the opportunity to work with post-16 providers and employers to develop the capacity and capability they will need to deliver the requirements of T Levels and, to design the system together. T Levels will have credibility with employers and prepare young people for skilled jobs of the future, supporting the aims of the Government’s Industrial Strategy to boost productivity and earning power across the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"reasons-for-providers-to-apply-to-deliver-in-2020-to-2021\"\u003eReasons for providers to apply to deliver in 2020 to 2021\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government is committed to the principle of co-creating T Levels. This means creating the T Level programmes and the overall system in partnership with employers and providers. Providers delivering in 2020 to 2021 will have the opportunity to work closely with DfE to shape and influence this flagship reform programme, designing and testing the details of the programme and the best approaches for implementation. This will serve as a foundation for all other providers to learn from as they get ready to deliver in the following years. In return, we will support providers with the additional funding for increased learning hours, with marketing and communications activity to promote the new programmes, and with the professional development of the teachers who will be delivering T Levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders delivering in September 2020 will see final qualifications materials for the first time in February 2020, rather than a full year in advance of teaching.

To assess this we will use the methodology published in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/642348/16-18_Accountability_Measures_Technical_Guide2.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e16 to 18 Accountability Measures Technical Guide\u003c/a\u003e. The methodology is described in paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 and Table 6.1.b of the guide. The benchmark we are looking for is an average grade of “Merit” or better. In summary, the methodology adds together the points achieved by students then divides by the number of entries to get the average score per entry. The same grading threshold is then used to turn them into an average grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all providers are included in the performance tables and not all qualifications use the same grading structure. Therefore these providers should refer to the published methodology, and follow this as closely as possible, to demonstrate an equivalent average grading. The data used and an outline of the methodology should be included with the survey return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe reserve the right to exclude any provider where a Notice to Improve is in place, where a provider is at risk of financial difficulty or where there are any other known issues that could prevent or affect quality delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny provider wishing to express an interest that has not yet been inspected by Ofsted will need to provide details to demonstrate that they have outstanding or good quality standards to be considered for delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-conditions-for-selecting-providers-for-the-2020-to-2021-academic-year\"\u003eFurther conditions for selecting providers for the 2020 to 2021 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"managing-provider-numbers\"\u003eManaging provider numbers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the event that there is significant interest from providers, we will apply further criteria to help us reach a manageable number for the year.

Once we have received applications, assessed them against our criteria and applied the additional criteria above to reach a short list, we will be able to see whether any providers from these areas have been selected. If there aren’t any/enough providers in this short list, we will re-assess all providers in opportunity areas, accepting a Good Ofsted grade as well as Outstanding and select them according to the core criteria and the additional criteria set out above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will allow students in opportunity areas to have a chance to access the new T Levels as early as possible.

We may therefore accept applications from these providers if they have an Ofsted rating of Good and meet the rest of the criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise that Institutes of Technology (IoTs) will not be established in time to participate in this process over the next few months, so we will consider how IoTs can best meet the criteria once they are established.

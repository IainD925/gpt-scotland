An appellant can appeal decisions relating to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epermission to stay in the UK\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edeportation from the UK\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eentry clearance into the UK\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the hearing the appellant normally gives their evidence first to help explain why they disagree with the decision. They may also be asked questions by the Home Office presenting officer and sometimes the judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-judge\"\u003eThe judge\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appeal will usually be heard by one judge. If you speak to the judge you should call them ‘judge’. The judge does not wear a wig or gown. The judge is independent of both parties. The judge will listen to the evidence from the all parties before making a decision. Usually the judge will need time to think about their decision. The appellant and the Home Office may not be told the outcome on the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-appellants-representative\"\u003eThe appellant’s representative\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appellant’s representative is the person who attends the hearing. They can advise the appellant and help them present their case. A representative might be legally qualified, a person from an advice centre or support organisation. Professional representatives need to be registered before they can appear in an immigration and asylum case. If the representative and the appellant are not in the same room, they should agree another way of communicating with each other, such as email, text or phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-home-office-presenting-officer\"\u003eThe Home Office presenting officer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presenting officer represents the Home Office.  They explain why the Home Office thinks its decision is correct. They’re likely to ask the appellant and any witnesses challenging questions about the case. Sometimes the presenting officer may be legally qualified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-clerk-and-tribunal-staff\"\u003eThe clerk and tribunal staff\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk (sometimes called ‘the usher’) will meet those attending the hearing. They’ll explain what happens during the hearing. The clerk will take those involved in the appeal to the hearing room and show them where to sit. They make sure everyone is ready for the judge and check any internet connection, video or audio links. They are also there to help deal with any problems during the hearing. The clerk will ask people to stand up when the judge enters and leaves the hearing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-interpreter\"\u003eThe interpreter\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn interpreter will attend the hearing if the appellant has asked for one. They’ll interpret what is said during the hearing so everyone can understand each other. Interpreters are independent of both sides. The interpreter should not be asked to translate documents. These should be translated and submitted before the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-witness\"\u003eThe witness\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe appellant or the Home Office may arrange for witnesses to attend the hearing. The judge will ask the witness to wait outside the hearing room until it’s time for them to give evidence. They may then stay in the room after they have finished if the judge agrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-pressmedia\"\u003eThe press/media\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe media can attend most tribunals by law. This includes those with reporting restrictions in place.  A key part of open justice is the reporting of hearings by the media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-public\"\u003eThe public\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmigration and asylum hearings are normally held in public. This means that people may sit quietly and listen at the back of the room unless the judge decides that it should be held in private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-hearing\"\u003eTypes of hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"remote\"\u003eRemote\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually a video hearing, in which everyone will have their own area on the screen, although the position may not stay the same. Occasionally they are done by telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"hybrid\"\u003eHybrid\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people may appear remotely while others are in the tribunal building. The number of people attending remotely, and who they are, will vary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"face-to-face\"\u003eFace to Face\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a tribunal building, although the layout of different rooms may vary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease note this is a representation only – the people in the room may be different. Not all courts look exactly alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

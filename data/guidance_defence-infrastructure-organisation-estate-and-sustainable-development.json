Its wide geographical distribution, past and current stewardship and position on marginal land means that it contains an extensive range of the habitats and species to be found in the UK. Its exceptional quality has attracted numerous national, European and international nature conservation designations. This confers a heavy responsibility on those charged with its stewardship, and is also a source of considerable pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe need to provide realistic training across challenging and demanding terrain in a variety of environments, as well as ranges, munitions stores and communication sites, means that \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e has responsibility for some of the most unspoilt and remote areas in Britain, the largest of which is defence training estate Salisbury Plain, which extends over 38,000 hectares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1973, the Nugent Report recommended the establishment of a \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e conservation officer to help target and co-ordinate the \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e’s conservation efforts.

This factsheet provides an overview of \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e’s historic buildings and discusses their management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e estate covers approximately 1% of the UK landmass, it is not surprising that the estate contains hundreds of historic buildings. In most cases, \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e’s historic buildings are listed and therefore protected by statute. At March 2009 the \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e estate had approximately 800 listings (equating to over 1000 buildings). However, there are also many non-designated buildings which may need to be considered as part of operational requirements or within any planning issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany buildings may not be of sufficient quality to warrant listing, but never-the-less are of value to the heritage and ethos of the Services and the \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e. For example the former operations centre at RAF Northolt which was part of the first coordinated air-defence system during World War 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"historic-buildings\"\u003eHistoric buildings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e’s historic buildings vary greatly in age and size. They can range from military buildings and sites, whether the Georgian dockyards, Victorian army barracks or the Cold War structures of Spadeadam. There are also a wide range of non-military buildings, such as tenanted farmhouses and barns on the rural training estates, schools, churches and chapels, lighthouses and buildings within castles (such as at Edinburgh, Stirling, Chester and Carlisle).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe largest single historic structure is the tunnel complex under Corsham which stretches in total for over 30 miles. The smallest structures are the listed milestones which indicate the way along former coaching roads, or the boundary bollards which surround some historic military bases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhilst some structures tower into the sky, such as the Second World War ‘Chain Home’ radar tower at Stenigot, others lie just below ground level, such as the Second World War ‘Pickett-Hamilton forts’ which were ‘pop-up’ pillboxes designed to protect airfields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"managing-mods-historic-buildings\"\u003eManaging \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e’s historic buildings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery site which has a listed building has in place a maintenance and inspection regime. Heritage specific inspections are carried out on a four yearly basis (Quadrennial Inspections). The renovation of the Block Mills in Portsmouth Naval Base is an excellent example, as is the re-instatement of the windows in the Keep of the 19th Century Tregantle Fort. Maintenance is an important consideration to preserve the functionality and value of the historic buildings and is regularly undertaken by sites, using specialist contractors as required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince the removal of Crown Immunity from the Planning Acts, \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e is required to obtain Listed Building Consent for alterations to its listed buildings which may impact on its significance. \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry Of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e consults with the appropriate authorities at an early stage regarding proposed changes.

After September 2008, lodging the data became a mandatory requirement. Due to the technical difficulty involved in formatting PDFs into searchable data, the statistics do not include data lodged as a PDF document only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn May 2009, additional validation checks were introduced into the register lodgement process to identify prescribed data quality issues. Before this period, statistics for domestic buildings may include anomalies to CO2 emission rates. In addition, statistics for domestic and non-domestic buildings and for DECs may include anomalies which affect total floor area figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn 1 April 2012, the first set of Scheme Operating Requirements came into effect for Domestic Energy Assessors, which set new rules for the operation of Accreditation Schemes. One new requirement was to introduce quality assurance audit of EPCs. The result was a demonstrable improvement in the quality of the lodged data from mid-2012 onwards. Users are asked to consider this when interpreting figures prior to that period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStatistics from October to December 2014 onwards includes EPCs for properties defined as park homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities cannot alter data which has been lodged on the \u003cabbr title=\"Energy Performance of Buildings\"\u003eEPB\u003c/abbr\u003e Register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"historic-series-and-archive-publications\"\u003eHistoric series and archive publications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 2010 and 2013, official statistics on the average energy efficiency of new homes in England and Wales were released quarterly as a sub-section of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/code-for-sustainable-homes-statistics\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCode for Sustainable Homes statistics series\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese statistics were drawn from \u003cabbr title=\"Energy Performance Certificate\"\u003eEPC\u003c/abbr\u003e certificates for new domestic buildings, held on the Energy Performance of Buildings Register.

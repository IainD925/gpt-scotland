There are 4 types of \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e (Types 1 to 4) and 2 subtypes (4A and 4B). A fifth putative \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e, PIV5, (formerly known as SV5) is commonly categorised as an ‘unknown haemabsorbing agent’ when clinical respiratory samples are propagated in laboratory cell culture. These viruses are unstable in the environment and are readily inactivated with soap and water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"clinical-features\"\u003eClinical features\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHPIV1-4 infection is one of the common causes of upper and lower respiratory tract disease, especially in young children. Similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza viruses\"\u003eHPIVs\u003c/abbr\u003e 1 to 4 can cause repeated infections throughout life, and  \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e types 1 to 4 can cause a full spectrum of respiratory illness, including the common cold, croup, and severe lower respiratory tract illness, such as bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDisease association with HPIV5 is  not well established, although it has been implicated in a range of chronic diseases outside the respiratory tract  among adults, most \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e 1-4 infections cause mild disease showing as upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e infections may also cause more severe diseases especially among the elderly and among patients who are immunocompromised. \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e infections are important causes of mortality among immunocompromised patients (1, 2, 3). The incubation period is from 1 to 7 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"epidemiological-features\"\u003eEpidemiological Features\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza viruses\"\u003eHPIVs\u003c/abbr\u003e are spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Health Protection Agency’s (now Public Health England) analysis of \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e infections in England and Wales found that \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-3 was the major \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e virus type causing most infections and outbreaks, followed by \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-1, \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-2 and \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-4 (4).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-3 infections had an annual epidemic cycle with a peak in late spring or summer, whereas peaks of \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-1 and \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-2 occurred at 1 or 2 year intervals in the late autumn or early winter. \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-4 has been detected in low levels and mainly appeared in the late autumn or early winter. Children under one year of age were the most commonly affected group, followed by those aged from 1 to 4 years . Other age groups were less affected. Males were slightly more affected than females.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"treatment-and-prevention\"\u003eTreatment and prevention\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo specific antiviral is presently licensed for treatment of \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e. There are currently no licensed vaccines available to protect against infection caused by any of the \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza viruses\"\u003eHPIVs\u003c/abbr\u003e (5,6,7). However, research is still on-going to try to develop vaccines against \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-1, \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-2 and \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-3 infections in laboratory and animal studies (6,8,9,10). A phase 2 study for the \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e-3 vaccine found it safe and immunogenic in children 6 to 18 months old (10).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn outbreak and cluster settings, to prevent onward transmission, strict attention to infection control measures such as hand washing and wearing protective equipments should decrease or prevent spread of infection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"surveillance\"\u003eSurveillance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePublic Health England (PHE) monitors \u003cabbr title=\"Human parainfluenza virus\"\u003eHPIV\u003c/abbr\u003e activity in the UK.

years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of calculating continuity of residence, continuity is not affected by absences from the UK which are less than 180 days in total in any single,

than 180 days in a 12-month period will usually mean the continuous period of residence has been broken for the purposes of an ILR application, unless an exemption applies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only exceptions are where you’re absent because you’re assisting with a national or international humanitarian crisis or helping with an environmental crisis overseas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have been absent from the UK for more than 180 days as a result of either coronavirus illness and/or travel restrictions associated with coronavirus,

would include overlooking the need for the existing business to be viable as demonstrated by the production of recent accounts during any period of coronavirus

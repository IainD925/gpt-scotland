There has been an increase in the number of fires in the UK and around the world linked to lithium-ion batteries, some of which have sadly led to people losing their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-cause-of-fires\"\u003eThe cause of fires\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnsafe, non-compliant or improperly used lithium-ion batteries can cause fires that can be particularly dangerous to people and property. The fires can start without warning, spread rapidly, and are very hard to extinguish.

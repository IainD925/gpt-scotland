UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be assessed without reporting the crime locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you file a report in the UK, Jordanian police inform us that it is far more difficult for them to investigate and take action. They are less likely to have any forensic evidence or to be able to carry out a detailed investigation as evidence such as CCTV is normally only kept for a few weeks. We are also aware that the transfer of a crime report from the UK to Jordan can take a considerable length of time, which again can affect the Jordanian police and the Jordanian court’s ability to take action.

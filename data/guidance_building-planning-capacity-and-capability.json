It will provide direct support now where it is needed most and create upskilling opportunities for those already within the sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis programme combined with our wider plans to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/increasing-planning-fees-and-performance-technical-consultation\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eincrease planning fees\u003c/a\u003e, and work with authorities to develop and adopt \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/digital-planning/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enew digital planning tools\u003c/a\u003e, will help to create a more modern, efficient, and sustainable planning service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe role of planning is essential for the building of the homes, infrastructure, and places needed for the benefit of all our communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-programme\"\u003eAbout the Programme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe programme has been developed alongside a working group formed by representatives from local government, professional bodies, and the private sector. This engagement has enabled a series of support interventions to be developed, in addition to the provision of targeted funding that aims to boost planning skills across local planning authorities and the wider planning sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo reinforce our existing planning sector knowledge and experience and to track the impact of this programme we have launched a local authority planning skills and resources survey with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-planning-capacity-and-skills-survey-2023-findings\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eresults from this first survey\u003c/a\u003e now published.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBelow we provide more detail of the range of support interventions within the programme and the intended outcomes they will deliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"developing-pathways-into-planning\"\u003eDeveloping pathways into planning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a range of new funding, we are \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/funding-boost-to-support-young-people-into-planning-careers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eextending and increasing our existing bursaries through the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI)\u003c/a\u003e. This will result in over 50 students receiving a £5,000 planning bursary for post-graduate study to support their future career in planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we are \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-scheme-to-support-graduates-into-town-and-planning-careers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esupporting the Local Government Association to develop a new Planning Graduate Programme\u003c/a\u003e. The recently announced Pathways to Planning Programme will place talented graduates in local councils, where initially 30 people will be able to secure a placement, while receiving a bursary to study towards a master’s degree qualification in planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"providing-direct-support\"\u003eProviding direct support\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecognising the current demands on the planning system we have launched a new £24 million Planning Skills Delivery Fund. This funding will support local authorities over the next 2 years to tackle backlogs in planning applications and boost their internal capacity and capabilities. Local authorities can find out more about the fund and access the application form on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/planning-skills-delivery-fund-year-1-guidance-for-applicants\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePlanning Skills Delivery Fund guidance page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo surge additional resources to the frontline, we will also be standing up a £13 million programme that will deploy teams of specialists into local planning authorities, starting with a trailblazing pathfinder in Cambridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have also awarded the social enterprise \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/skills-boost-for-planning-authorities-to-create-better-neighbourhoods\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePublic Practice £1 million to help councils recruit and develop skilled planners\u003c/a\u003e. This placement programme will be extended to more locations allowing even more local authorities to recruit experienced and skilled planners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"creating-opportunities-for-upskilling\"\u003eCreating opportunities for upskilling\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of this programme, we have extended and increased our funding to the Planning Advisory Service (PAS) for the next 2 years. PAS is a recognised partner that provides consultancy, peer support, learning events and online resources to support local authorities.

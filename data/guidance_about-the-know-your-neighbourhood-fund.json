The National Lottery Community Fund is also investing up to £10 million to support their existing projects working across the same target areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a competitive process, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Culture, Media and Sport\"\u003eDCMS\u003c/abbr\u003e) confirmed in January that £14 million of the total £19 million government funding would be delivered by UK Community Foundations (\u003cabbr title=\"UK Community Foundations\"\u003eUKCF\u003c/abbr\u003e) and a consortium of local community foundations across 9 local authority areas. These are: Wolverhampton, South Tyneside, Kingston-upon-Hull, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Great Yarmouth, Fenland, County Durham and Barrow-in-Furness. This funding is being  targeted at people who have not had opportunities to volunteer before, or who are experiencing loneliness. They are being supported to access enriching opportunities that will help to improve their wellbeing, skills, confidence and social connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Culture, Media and Sport\"\u003eDCMS\u003c/abbr\u003e sectors offer opportunities for people to participate in volunteering and connect with others in their areas. The remaining £5 million of government funding is  therefore being invested in supporting people to participate in volunteering and connect with others through expanding the existing offer of arts, culture and heritage activities across the 27 \u003cabbr title=\"Know Your Neighbourhood\"\u003eKYN\u003c/abbr\u003e target areas. This funding is being delivered by Arts Council England (\u003cabbr title=\"Arts Council England\"\u003eACE\u003c/abbr\u003e) and the National Lottery Heritage Fund (\u003cabbr title=\"National Lottery Heritage Fund\"\u003eNLHF\u003c/abbr\u003e), in partnership with Historic England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Arts Council England\"\u003eACE\u003c/abbr\u003e is delivering funding to arts and culture organisations across the 27 areas through partnership working with three delivery bodies: the Association of Independent Museums, Creative Lives, and Libraries Connected. \u003cabbr title=\"National Lottery Heritage Fund\"\u003eNLHF\u003c/abbr\u003e is working with Historic England to deliver additional funding through their established High Street Heritage Action Zones programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Know Your Neighbourhood\"\u003eKYN\u003c/abbr\u003e Fund will run until March 2025.

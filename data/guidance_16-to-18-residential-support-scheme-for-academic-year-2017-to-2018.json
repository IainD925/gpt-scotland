The programme must be directly 16 to 19 funded by ESFA.  Study programmes delivered by institutions that have a sub-contracting relationship with an ESFA funded institution are not eligible for RSS funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should refer to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eESFA Funding Regulations\u003c/a\u003e for the 2017 to 2018 academic year for more detail about programme funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe full Level 2 or full Level 3 substantial qualification should normally be the student’s first qualification at those levels. In exceptional circumstances, RSS may be available to students undertaking additional qualifications at the same level they already hold.

Any such support must be a genuine exception; ESFA does not expect RSS to be used for this purpose on a routine basis. Institutions should refer to ESFA if they have any doubts about particular cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"substantial-qualification-which-is-not-available-within-reasonable-daily-travelling-distance\"\u003eSubstantial qualification which is not available within reasonable daily travelling distance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for RSS, a student must not be able to access the same or similar substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification within reasonable daily travelling distance of their home address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen assessing RSS eligibility, it is the substantial ESFA funded qualification that is key. The study programme as a whole or the combination of different modules within it is not considered as part of the assessment of eligibility.  If a student can access the substantial qualification within daily travelling distance of their home, they will not be eligible for RSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA defines reasonable daily travelling distance as a daily return journey that takes 2 hours or less on public transport; or a distance of under 15 miles from the student’s home or term-time lodgings to the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"applying-for-rss\"\u003eApplying for RSS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must apply for RSS each academic year they need support from the scheme. This is to enable the institution to check that students still meet all the criteria for support, including household income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents apply for RSS directly from their chosen institution. Students must have an unconditional offer of a place before they can apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are reminded that if students apply for RSS part way through the year they may only award RSS from the beginning of the term in which the student applied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should have their own application forms which students complete to seek RSS funding. They may wish to continue to use the example application form provided by  ESFA in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, updated each year as appropriate, or can use any alternative application of their own design. All application forms used by students to apply for RSS must include all the information required to assess if students meet the eligibility requirements set out in this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important for audit purposes that the student and responsible adult(s) sign and date the RSS application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should ensure that they obtain evidence of the student’s term accommodation arrangement, for example, a copy of the student’s tenancy agreement. The tenancy agreement (or other evidence accepted by the institution) must have been agreed and signed by the student.  It must include the following information:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe student’s name\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe student’s term time address\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe dates of the tenancy\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe cost of the rent\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe landlord’s name, address and signature (please note: the landlord cannot be related to the student)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe student’s term time lodgings must be no further than 15 miles from campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must not release any RSS payments until all the required information/evidence has been provided by the student and they have fully assessed the application.  This includes obtaining confirmation from ESFA that each student’s substantial qualification meets the conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must make payments directly to eligible students’ landlords for their rental costs. Proof of payment should be kept for audit purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should not make RSS payments to students.  The only exception to this rule would be in circumstances where a student has already paid some of their rent before the institution has fully assessed their RSS application.  In this instance, institutions may reimburse these costs, as long as the rental period the student has paid for is within the agreed period of the RSS award.  Institutions must keep proof of payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"verification-of-the-students-substantial-qualification\"\u003eVerification of the student’s substantial qualification\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"new-students\"\u003eNew students\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must complete a course verification proforma to ask ESFA to verify each student’s substantial qualification as part of the RSS application process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can verify eligibility of a new student’s substantial qualification with ESFA before they have assessed the student against the other eligibility criteria or afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may send one proforma for all new students seeking RSS funding for verification or separate proformas to verify individuals.  ESFA request, however, that institutions submit course verification proformas as soon as possible in the academic year.  This ensures students do not make financial commitments on the assumption they will receive RSS funding when they may not be entitled to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will sent institutions with an RSS allocation for the 2017 to 2018 academic year a new course verification proforma in April 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must complete the proforma in full, providing the following information:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003estudent’s home postcode and Individualised Learner Record number\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einstitution name, delivery location postcode and UPIN\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003equalification reference number and qualification title of the substantial Level 2 or Level 3 qualification the student is following as part of their study programme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA cannot verify any proforma institutions send with missing or incomplete information.

High pressure is applied to the metal which is then forced through a die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCold extrusion is a similar process as hot extrusion, but with the metal kept at room temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSintering is a process where compacted metal powder (obtained by moulding) is passed under a burner and ignites. Air drawn through the powder causes any Sulphur or carbon present to oxidise. This causes a partial fusion of the particles in the powder, forming a porous cellular clinker (a sinter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClosed-die forging is a process where hot metal is shaped within the walls of 2 dies that enclose the work piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnnealing is the heating of a metal or alloy to a predetermined temperature (below its melting point), maintaining the temperature before cooling slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePig iron, is an iron-carbon alloy not usefully malleable, containing more than 2% by weight of carbon and which may contain by weight one or more other elements within the following limits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 10% of chromium\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 6% of manganese\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 3% of phosphorus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 8% of silicon\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea total of not more than 10% of other elements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpiegeleisen, is an iron-carbon alloy containing by weight more than 6% but not more than 30% of manganese and otherwise conforming to the specification of pig iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFerro-alloys, are alloys in pigs, blocks, lumps or similar primary forms, in forms obtained by continuous casting and also in granular or powder forms, whether or not agglomerated, commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in ferrous metallurgy and generally not usefully malleable, containing by weight 4% or more of the element iron and one or more of the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore than 10% of chromium\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore than 30% of manganese\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore than 3% of phosphorus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore than 8% of silicon\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea total of more than 10% of other elements, excluding carbon, subject to a maximum content of 10% in the case of copper\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese may also contain by weight one or more other elements within the following limits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 10% of chromium\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 6% of manganese\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 3% of phosphorus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot more than 8% of silicon\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea total of not more than 10% of other elements.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"classes-of-steel\"\u003eClasses of Steel\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSteels can be grouped into one of the 3 classes of chemical composition.

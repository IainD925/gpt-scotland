It allows the job holder to understand what you are capable of, it shows that you can apply the same behaviours to the new role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe competency framework centres on ‘how’ you achieved the outcome. Therefore it is important that you show how your behaviour led to the outcome.  It should always be remembered that the competencies required of each job role differs from position to position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"getting-started\"\u003eGetting started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWrite down examples of tasks that you have done well over the past 2 years (or longer).  Use evidence from work if you can, though your examples don’t need to be work related.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFor each of these things note down how you achieved what you did, what skills and behaviours did you use?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLook at the effective competency indicators and for each bit of work, note which competencies it might cover.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGather your evidence together and review it before you start writing examples – you probably have more evidence than you think!\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA second or third pair of eyes is always useful.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"hints-and-tips-on-your-examples\"\u003eHints and tips on your examples\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"choosing-your-examples\"\u003eChoosing your examples;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhen deciding which examples to use, keep referring back to the job advert and the competency framework document for effective behaviour indicators.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTailor your competencies to the job that you are applying for. There are different levels of the competency framework for different grades.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTry to fit your examples to the advertised post.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUnderline any key words and phrases in the job advert to include in your examples.\nIf you have any doubts about the advert please speak to the contact point named in the advert to find out more about the advertised post.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"writing-your-examples\"\u003eWriting your examples\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAllow yourself plenty of time for writing your examples – avoid leaving them until the last minute.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTailor your competencies to the job that you are applying for.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThere are different levels of the competency framework for the different grades.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUse the competency framework to highlight effective behaviours you used. Keep looking back at the competency bullet points and cover the key points.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eChoose your most powerful examples – demanding/challenging situations that have lots of substance.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFocus on the ‘how’ throughout your competency. For example “I worked collaboratively across teams, establishing relationships and encouraging cross team working”.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUse ‘I’ not ‘we’. This is about your role in the task and how you affected the outcome.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUse your own words. Consider using active verbs to create greater impact.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDon’t assume the sift panel has any knowledge of the situation or context.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIt’s all down to you. The sift panel cannot infer what is not included in the example and can only assess what you have actually written.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEnsure that there is a clear outcome stated.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDon’t get caught up telling a story in your example. Just give enough to show - how you went about the task, why you did it the way you did and describe any obstacles you encountered.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"approaches-to-writing-competencies\"\u003eApproaches to writing competencies.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompetency examples requires more than just information about what you did, it requires you to explain. There are many different approaches you could take to writing competencies, such as the STAR, or the CAR method. As to which one you chose to use, it’s all down to your personal style of writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the Civil Service, the most common approach is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-star-method\"\u003eThe STAR method\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the STAR method, allows you to set the scene, show what and how you did and the overall outcome. The job holder (and later the interviewer) will use these method to gather all the relevant information about a specific capability that the job requires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSituation - Describe the situation you found yourself in. You must describe a specific event or situation. Be sure to give enough detail for the job holder to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhere are you?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWho was there with you?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat had happened?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTask -  The job holder will want to understand what you tried to achieve from the situation you found yourself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat was the task that you had to complete and why?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat did you have to achieve?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eActions - What did you do? The job holder will be looking for information of what you did, how you did it and why. \nKeep the focus on you. What specific steps did you take and what was your contribution? Remember to include how you did it, and the behaviours you used. \nTry to use “I” rather than “we” to explain your actions that lead to the result. Be careful not to take credit of something that you did not do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults -  Don’t be shy about taking credit for your behaviour. Quote specific facts and figures easily understandable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat results did the actions produce?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your goals?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWas it a successful outcome? If not what did you learn from the experience?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKeep the situation and task parts brief. Concentrate on the action and the result. If the result was not entirely successful describe what you learned from this and what you would do differently next time. Make sure you focus on your strengths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot everyone can relate to the STAR method, so an alternative approach is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-car-approach\"\u003eThe CAR approach\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContext - Explain the situation; what, where and when.  Simply describe the challenge that you faced. Give the reader some background, just enough to set the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eActions - Make sure that you explain how you did something not just what you did. What action or steps did you take? How did you do it? For some jobs, it might be quite detailed, but don’t talk about every single thing. Summarise as best as you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults - What was the outcome? What results did you achieve? Talk about the results. Use numbers and percentages whenever possible. Remember if your result is not positive, describe what you have learnt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhen writing your competency example make sure you cover both ‘what’ you did and ‘how’ you did it. In most examples you should focus more words on the ‘how’ than the ‘what’.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFollow this by a brief summary of the ‘outcome’.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUse either STAR or CAR approach for writing your competency.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCompetencies allow job holders to see what you are capable of doing, it shows them what you can also do for them as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"we-wish-you-luck-when-applying-for-a-job\"\u003eWe wish you luck when applying for a job.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

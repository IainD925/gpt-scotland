Different methods are suitable for answering different types of evaluation questions. This section provides an overview of the most common methods. The resources referred to at the end of this section give more detail on different methods and how to use them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"qualitative-research\"\u003eQualitative research\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQualitative research encompasses a variety of methods, but is often defined in terms of using words and text in data collection and analysis, rather than using numerical measurement and quantification (Bryman, A (2015), ‘Social research methods’ (fifth edition) Oxford University Press, Oxford). It commonly investigates how people make sense of the world and experience events. For example, it might explore how it feels to be a patient with a long-term condition or what it is like to live with someone with a terminal illness, and aim to gain insight into how people make sense of and manage these situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQualitative research is usually ‘bottom up’ rather than ‘top down’. That is, a theory or explanation is developed from the data rather than data being collected to test a theory or hypothesis. Qualitative research often aims to describe and explain rather than predict or identify cause and effect. It can be used to enrich our understanding of an issue or to improve services (Willig, C (2008), ‘Introducing qualitative research in psychology: adventures in theory and method’ Open University Press, Oxford).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQualitative research is not concerned with representing a population, in the way that quantitative research is, but with investigating topics in depth (Willig, 2008). Usually, a relatively small number of people are included in a sample because of the richness of the data collected and the time it takes to collect and analyse information. Sometimes, simple qualitative research methods are combined with quantitative research, for example, via the inclusion of a comments section within a questionnaire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"benefits-of-qualitative-research\"\u003eBenefits of qualitative research\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits to using qualitative methods include that they:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare useful for investigating the perspectives and interpretations of participants in a holistic fashion\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare less dependent than quantitative methods on the pre-conceived ideas of the researchers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efacilitate new or deeper insights into, and understanding of, a phenomenon (this can be very useful where little is known about a topic and exploratory research is required)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecan be used to investigate unusual cases from which valuable insights can be gained (in quantitative research these ‘outliers’ may be discarded)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecan usually be modified on an ongoing basis as new insights are gained – for example, to explore if unexpected findings emerge\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis adaptable – for example, the order and style of questions in an interview or focus group can be altered to fit or accommodate the needs of different participants or groups\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecan be coded and summarised in a quantitative way, if desired\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"limitations-of-qualitative-research\"\u003eLimitations of qualitative research\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe limitations of qualitative methods include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey are generally time-consuming to use – it can take a lot of time to arrange and undertake data collection (such as via interviews and focus groups), transcribe discussions, analyse data, and interpret and present findings in a meaningful way\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edata analysis can be challenging and relies on having the necessary knowledge and skills, such as in qualitative data analysis approaches, techniques, analysis software\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey produce data and findings which may vary depending on the skills and theoretical perspectives of the researchers collecting, analysing and interpreting the data – however, the reporting of qualitative research should make this process transparent to allow the reader to judge findings in light of this\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey usually collect and analyse data from relatively small numbers of participants, meaning that the generalisability of findings is not addressed and trends or distributions of views within a population are not ascertained\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe anonymity and confidentiality of participants is more difficult to maintain\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"qualitative-research-tools\"\u003eQualitative research tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"interviews\"\u003eInterviews\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews are frequently used to collect data in qualitative research. They are usually based on a topic guide. In evaluation studies, interviews are commonly semi-structured where questions or themes are decided in advance, but the interviewer has flexibility to re-order the questions and follow-up with further questions, if necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews allow topics to be explored in depth. These topics can be adapted to take account of participant’s needs (for example, if there are language or disability challenges) or experiences (for example, skipping questions which are not relevant). An interviewee might also discuss a topic without being prompted or the interviewer might change the order of the questions depending on the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn semi-structured interviews, questions are usually relatively ‘open’ – that is, they encourage a detailed answer from the interviewee rather than a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response. Generally, the interview topic guide or schedule would contain prompts in case a topic doesn’t naturally arise. Leading questions or otherwise indicating to an interviewee that a certain type of answer is the ‘right’ one should be avoided as this would bias the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews can be conducted by telephone, through an online video resource or in person. There are benefits and drawbacks of using the telephone or online video compared to face-to-face interviews, summarised below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages of telephone or online video interviews are they:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare cheaper in terms of staff time and travel\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eavoid wasted time if the sample population has a high rate of ‘no-shows’ for interviews\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare more practical if the interviewee lives far away, or if they have problems travelling\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eallow more people to be interviewed due to reduced cost and time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLimitations of telephone or online video interviews are they:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake it more difficult to establish a rapport with the interviewee\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake it difficult to assess how interviewees are reacting to questions because their body language cannot be observed\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etend to be shorter and are less suitable for sensitive topics\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erely on having access to online video packages or good phone connection or reception, which may be problematic for some harder-to-reach participants\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages of face-to-face interviews are they:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecapture verbal and non-verbal cues and responses to questions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eobserve emotions and body language\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eestablish a rapport with the interviewee\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLimitations of face-to-face video interviews are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey require a number of people to conduct the interviews, which means there will be personnel costs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003equality of data you receive will often depend on the ability of the interviewer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esize of the sample can be limited to the size of your interviewing staff, the area in which the interviews are conducted, and the number of qualified respondents within that area\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey are more expensive and require time for travelling\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn advance of the interview, researchers should decide if: the interview should be recorded, how it will be transcribed and analysed and how excerpts will be presented in any write up. In line with research ethics, it is good practice to discuss confidentiality issues and ask interviewees to read and sign a consent form to confirm that they are happy with the arrangements. Complete transcription of recordings is very time-consuming and partial transcriptions or summaries are sometimes used, depending on the type of evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews can be tiring for interviewers, as they have to listen carefully to determine which topic to go to next and to ensure understanding. If the interviews are lengthy, it is generally a good idea not to arrange more than 2 in a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"focus-groups\"\u003eFocus groups\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFocus groups bring together a small number of selected participants to discuss a specific topic and are usually facilitated by someone who does not know the group. The participants might be strangers or people who meet together already. In general, it is best not to include people with more power than others in the same group, such as teachers and pupils or junior and senior staff, as this can stop participants being open with their views or opinions. It takes time to set up a focus group and to ensure that everyone attends. Set up can be easier if the group is run alongside a regular meeting. For example, if you are interested in the views of men with an alcohol problem, you might try to get permission to conduct a focus group before or after an alcohol support group session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFocus groups have similarities to interviews in that a facilitator uses a topic guide or scenario (see below) to ask particular questions and steer the discussion. The person who facilitates the focus group should be experienced, and there is training available to support development of relevant skills. Facilitators must ensure that one person does not dominate the discussion and that everyone gets the opportunity to have their views heard. The facilitator should not have a particular vested interest in the findings, so they do not lead the discussion or impose their own views. The facilitator should always be neutral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is useful to record a focus group or at least have a second person taking notes of the discussion as it is difficult to do this alongside facilitating the group. As with interviews, issues of consent and confidentiality should be discussed with participants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages of focus groups are that they:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare useful when the interactions and contributions within the group may prompt additional, interesting themes to arise\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare useful when time is short and there is a need to get a range of people’s views quickly\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etend to work well for existing groups where people are comfortable with speaking to each other and are confident in expressing their opinion in a group situation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecan be useful for understanding how and why different groups or types of participants have differing views (for example, men versus women, patients versus health professionals)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDisadvantages of focus groups are that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey are generally less useful for recording the responses of individual participants, as it can be difficult to note this down accurately during a discussion, or to identify individuals from a recording during transcription\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey are less suitable to use with some participants – especially if the topic to be discussed is sensitive\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epeople with hearing problems might also find a group discussion difficult\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey can be challenging and require training to facilitate, especially if there are disagreements amongst participants, dominant participants, or discussions get side-tracked away from the main topics of interest\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey produce complex data which can be particularly difficult and time-consuming to transcribe, summarise, and analyse\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"topic-guide\"\u003eTopic guide\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTopic guides include questions and prompts used when conducting a focus group or interview. They are called guides because they are meant to be adapted to the needs and experiences of the interviewee or focus group and used in a flexible way. The content of a guide would be decided based on the evaluation questions and objectives as well as after discussions with any oversight or steering group and/or with the type of people you will be interviewing. It is a good idea to test questions with a pilot group to ensure they are understandable and appropriate for the type of participants in the sample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if you were interviewing smokers about resources and services for quitting smoking in Manchester, you may wish to meet with a group of smokers in Liverpool (to talk to smokers in a similar area who are likely to have similar experiences) to discuss what topics should be included and what language should be used. It is most useful to ask open-ended questions to encourage participants to speak, and it is usual to start with some generic questions at the beginning to relax the participants and build a rapport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, you might want to start with a question which asks for some background and gauges the participants’ knowledge of the area. This will help with adapting later topics and deciding in which order to ask questions. The opening questions also give insight into how forthcoming participants are likely to be. Some people speak readily and at length whereas others can be more reluctant to express their views and need prompts to explore issues in depth. This is particularly important if the topic is of a sensitive nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"scenarios\"\u003eScenarios\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eScenarios can also be used in interviews or focus groups to depersonalise an issue. If a topic is sensitive and people might be uncomfortable talking about their own experiences, they could be asked to give advice to someone else in a similar situation or to imagine a person and what their responses would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if you wanted to interview someone about addictions and their views on the services available, you could ask: ‘If a friend or neighbour wished to access addiction services in this area what advice would you give them? What problems might you highlight? Where would you suggest that they start?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, if you wanted to gain insight into the concerns of someone with terminal illness regarding hospices, you might say: ‘Mr McKenzie is moving to a hospice 20 miles from his home after a long illness. His wife is elderly and 2 of his 4 children have moved away from the area. What do you think his concerns might be? What about those of his wife and children?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis would allow participants to discuss a topic in a more general way without feeling that the questions are intrusive or require sharing too much personal information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"other-qualitative-methods\"\u003eOther qualitative methods\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many more qualitative research methods such as naturalistic or ethnographic observations, video recordings of behaviour, open-ended questions on questionnaires, and analysis of text (for example, in advertising or educational materials) or photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"analysing-qualitative-data\"\u003eAnalysing qualitative data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn-depth qualitative analysis requires training and experience. It can be conducted in different ways but usually proceeds in the following stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIt is usually helpful to thoroughly familiarise yourself with the data by reading and re-reading transcripts or notes, or by listening to recordings.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNext, segments of data are labelled through ‘coding’, and then higher level, more interpretive themes are developed from these codes in one or more further stages.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLater stages often involve organising themes (for example, into groups), exploring their relationships with each other and observing patterns in the data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, qualitative analysis goes beyond merely summarising data, to drawing out underlying themes that provide in-depth insight into an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are computer packages that can help with analysis of qualitative data. The most common of these are NVivo, Atlas and MAXQDA. These programmes allow large amounts of qualitative data to be stored, analysed and summarised in a systematic way. Use of these packages requires training and a good understanding of qualitative methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"quantitative-methods\"\u003eQuantitative methods\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuantitative methods are used to investigate things that can be measured or quantified to generate numerical data. For example, what percentage of people hold a particular view, does use of a service vary by gender and age, what has changed after a particular intervention? Quantitative research aims to be objective and usually collects data in a pre-defined, structured way (Black, T R (1999), ‘Doing quantitative research in the social sciences: an integrated approach to research design, measurement and statistics’ Sage Publishing). It is used to describe general trends or distributions, or to test a theory or hypothesis about relationships between things, including cause and effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuantitative research methods usually aim to tell you something about a population (for example, smokers or older adults) based on a representative sample selected for a study. However, evaluation studies do not always make claims for the population at large, and may only provide more specific information about the effects of an intervention in a specific group of people or context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOften, the aim of an evaluation is to find out how things have changed after an intervention. For example, are clinicians more knowledgeable about correct hand washing techniques after a training session? Alternatively, an evaluation may assess whether a service achieves a pre-existing standard. For example, have young people with mental health problems been offered support within a defined time period? See the section on outcome evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen planning an evaluation, you should identify what data is needed, from whom and when. This will be influenced by the questions being addressed and the most suitable study design for answering these questions within the resources available. It is important to determine if the required data are already available and accessible, or whether the data will need to be collected as this will have time and resource implications. It may be possible to directly observe (for example, to produce counts) or measure (for example, using specialist equipment or monitoring to assess physiological markers) the phenomena of interest. However, evaluation often relies on self-reported or pre-existing data, and various tools are available to support collection of this type of data. See the section on evaluation planning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"quantitative-research-tools\"\u003eQuantitative research tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"surveys-and-questionnaires\"\u003eSurveys and questionnaires\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA common and quick way of collecting quantitative data from large samples of people is through surveys and questionnaires. Data collected from questionnaires and surveys allow comparisons between groups and subgroups to decide if there are differences between them, and to explore potential reasons for these differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuestionnaires are less useful when you wish to conduct more exploratory research (for example, where you might not have enough understanding of something to know what questions to include). They are also unsuitable for understanding aspects such as the meaning of participant experiences or for exploring issues in-depth. In these cases, qualitative methods are usually more suitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch5 id=\"questionnaire-administration\"\u003eQuestionnaire administration\u003c/h5\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are different ways of administering surveys and questionnaires.

If possible, it is better to use or adapt a questionnaire that has been used for similar purposes or in a similar sample and, ideally, has been demonstrated to be reliable and valid – see outcome evaluation section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen selecting or designing a questionnaire, these issues may be considered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewho is your sample; who do you need to answer the questions; will they complete the questionnaire\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhere or how can you best reach these people\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehow can you ensure a good response rate\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eif the answers are confidential, how to ensure this\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare the questions simple and clear and only ask about one issue at a time\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eavoid jargon in questions - this can be tested by piloting the questionnaire\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eavoid leading questions (for example you would not ask ‘why did you like the service?’; ask ‘did you like the service?

Certain permissions (for example ethics approval, letters of access) may need to be obtained to allow access to these data. A data collection ‘pro forma’ which specifies the data required is sometimes designed and can then be populated using the existing data sources. Alternatively, a request can be made for data or reports for a sample of patients to be transferred directly to the evaluator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecondary data collection, however, can also have its own challenges. Some data may be confidential or stored in a way that makes the data hard to access or to use for the desired purpose. Sometimes, data should be available in theory, but, in practice, they are missing, misfiled or not collected consistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"analysing-quantitative-data\"\u003eAnalysing quantitative data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome quantitative analyses required for evaluation will be quite simple – for example, describing the number or percentage of people with a certain characteristic, achieving a goal or expressing a particular opinion. This analysis can usually be managed in Excel. More complex analyses (for example, comparing groups, looking at difference between subgroups, or controlling for extraneous factors) will require knowledge of statistical analyses and associated software packages (for example, SPSS, Stata, SAS). Support for statistical training or knowledge of the relevant software packages will need be to identified when planning an evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"combining-qualitative-and-quantitative-research\"\u003eCombining qualitative and quantitative research\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQualitative and quantitative methods can usefully be combined in ‘mixed methods’ research to provide more comprehensive information for an evaluation (Andrew, S and Halcomb, E J (2009), ‘Mixed methods research for nursing and the health sciences’ Blackwell, West Sussex). You may wish to use qualitative research to find out how people feel and follow this with quantitative research to find out if these feelings are commonly experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if you want to explore pregnant mothers’ understanding and knowledge of antenatal care and their compliance with recommendations, you could start by conducting a focus group of mothers from different areas and backgrounds. This qualitative research would give you an insight into their knowledge and other the main topics that are important. You could then use these topics to develop a questionnaire to discover what is happening across the population of expecting mothers as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, you may have obtained findings from a questionnaire and wish to discuss these with a focus group to get a deeper understanding of what the results mean. For example, if data from a survey or questionnaire shows that one hospital has more infections than others, you may wish to follow this up by interviewing staff or visiting the hospital and undertaking observations to get a more in-depth understanding of why that might be and how it could be resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew, S and Halcomb, E J (2009): ‘Mixed methods research for nursing and the health sciences’.

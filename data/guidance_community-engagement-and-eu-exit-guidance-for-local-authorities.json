A key part of this is to ensure community voices are heard and valued, so people have – and feel they have – a say over the decisions that matter most to them in their local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the coming months, the government will continue its work to ensure that the UK remains a country where people live, work, learn and socialise together and share rights and responsibilities, whatever their background. We have published the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-communities-action-plan\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eIntegrated Communities Action Plan\u003c/a\u003e, clearly setting out the actions we will take across government to build stronger, integrated communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe transition will affect areas in different ways, so local leadership will be critical in ensuring that people feel reassured and can come together as we exit the EU, and in the months and years which follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe understand that the period before and following 1 January 2021 may create uncertainty for some people, and we want to work with partners, including local leaders, to ensure that communities feel engaged, supported and reassured. Because they know their areas and residents best and have a critical role in bringing partners together, local leaders are central to offering support and reassurance to their communities during this time of change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiversity enriches communities, brings new perspectives and can stimulate local growth. It makes us the outward-looking nation we are today. After the UK leaves the EU, EU citizens living in the UK will be able to continue to live their lives much as they do now. They are welcome in the UK and we want them to participate fully in their communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance aims to provide local authorities with support on the ways in which they can understand, engage and reassure their communities in the lead up to and after leaving the EU as part of their work to build stronger, better integrated communities. It is part of the package of support being offered to local authorities. This includes a network of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhclg-eu-exit-local-information-sharing\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enine local authority chief executives from across England\u003c/a\u003e established to engage with councils in their areas, a weekly e-bulletin to all chief executives and leaders of local authorities, a dedicated \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-government-brexit-preparedness\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGOV.UK page\u003c/a\u003e signposting relevant guidance from across Whitehall and a series of thematic events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEU citizens may require particular support in this period, for example being informed about the need to apply to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEU Settlement Scheme\u003c/a\u003e if they wish to stay in the UK long-term. This support sits alongside issues of importance among communities of all backgrounds that councils should reflect upon and address through their ongoing engagement plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils do critical work to support integration. Included in this document are a number of examples of what local authorities are already doing to engage and support their communities. Many of these programmes and activities have been part of a long-term strategy to build strong links with and across communities and embed integration across a range of policy areas, including education, housing and health and well-being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis document also provides a set of issues to consider that councils and their partners may want to use in reviewing their engagement activities. In addition, it is underpinned by support for communities and partners through funding for hate crime reporting platforms, including Tell Mama and True Vision. We will continue to engage with communities themselves to make sure we understand and respond to their concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"effective-community-engagement\"\u003eEffective community engagement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal leaders have an important role to play in generating trust, addressing misinformation and providing support in relation to the UK’s exit from the EU. Community engagement offers a means of building links with communities, challenging misconceptions and offering reassurance, including with vulnerable groups. In this way it can be an effective method to reduce any risks of community tensions and quickly addressing these should they occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany councils will regularly run forums to keep in touch with the local community and engage with residents on a range of policy issues. They also participate in and can encourage forums run by leaders within their communities. These can range widely from, for example, interfaith forums to residents’ groups. Many of these forums have been built over several years and therefore rely on longstanding relationships. They are a useful source of information and provide networks for disseminating key messages. They also offer a platform for constructive engagement on issues which people may hold disparate views, such as Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile well-established forums offer many advantages, councils have reported that some groups, including EU citizens, may sometimes be under-represented. To address this, some councils have adopted targeted approaches to reach those who wouldn’t normally be engaged (for example, by holding engagement sessions in workplaces, deploying community outreach workers or working with intermediaries such as those in the faith sector).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also important to recognise that leaving the EU will affect everyone. This is why some councils are putting in place specific Brexit platforms aimed at engaging all residents, particularly those who may feel most unsettled or need additional support. Wide-reaching community engagement can be a way of ensuring that all groups in the community feel supported and listened to. At its best, this can help build and strengthen common bonds across communities, including between groups who may hold different views on Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"understanding-the-issues\"\u003eUnderstanding the issues\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the diversity of place and interests, councils will be best placed to decide the kinds of messages which are likely to playout best in their communities. A number of councils have developed methods to gather information about their communities. This ranges from conducting regular surveys to carrying out community outreach. Citizens’ forums, residents’ panels and town hall meetings can be an effective way of testing messages and developing narratives which are likely to be most successful in a given context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"communications-and-campaigns\"\u003eCommunications and campaigns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has been clear that it values the contribution EU citizens make to this country and the benefits of our diverse society. It has stressed that it wants EU citizens currently in the UK to stay and has committed to protect their rights – whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  It has also underlined its commitment to challenging all forms of hate crime and discrimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal leaders, including local authorities, can play a critical role in sharing this messaging and ensuring it reaches EU citizens and the wider community. In addition to providing practical information about the EU Settlement Scheme (see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-community-leaders-toolkit/toolkit-introduction-how-to-use-the-local-authorities-toolkit-in-your-community-or-network\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSupporting the EU Settlement Scheme\u003c/a\u003e for guidance), local leaders can help ensure that EU residents feel recognised and welcome, while stressing that discrimination or hate crime will not be tolerated. They can also play a critical role in reassuring the wider community and ensuring that there is an understanding of the status of EU citizens and the valuable contribution they make and will continue to make following Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome local authorities have opted to launch specific Brexit related campaigns to inform and facilitate the public debate in ways that recognise differences of view but seek to avoid tensions. Other local leaders are doing so by sharing their messages via existing networks or in partnership with others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile in some cases communities may respond well to campaigns which are focused on providing factual information; for others these approaches can prove counterproductive. Alternative approaches are being trialled in some councils, such as ones which facilitate personal contact between those who hold strong views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reaching-all-sections-of-the-community\"\u003eReaching all sections of the community\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA number of local authorities are complementing the work they are doing via residents’ events and road shows with online forums that can reach residents who are less likely to participate in the community. Local authorities can also use their own social media channels to signpost support and work with influential faith and community leaders to ensure these messages reach all communities. Working alongside intermediaries from the private sector or the community can be an effective way of offering reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are many models of implementation, effective community engagement models often share a number of common practices. Below we provide some of the questions councils and their partners may wish to ask of themselves as they design their approaches to community engagement in the context of Brexit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"barking-and-dagenham--listening-to-the-community\"\u003eBarking and Dagenham – listening to the community\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2001, the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham has seen the highest rates of population growth and turnover in the UK. From being a borough where a significant majority of its population were White British only two decades ago, it is rapidly becoming one of the most diverse parts of the capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe borough, with support from the government’s Controlling Migration Fund, has developed a data-led, systems approach to understand the impact of rapid population change on residents. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative insight from focus groups, resident surveys, the borough’s Social Progress Index, and tools which map change in community demographics, the council has been able to understand the way different residents perceive community change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to better listen to and understand the views and values of residents the council has taken a number of steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003elaunched a community ‘amplifiers’ programme, recruiting local residents as researchers focusing on under-represented groups, including EU citizens, to build relationships using participatory and storytelling techniques aimed at increasing harmony through appreciating different worldviews and practices\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edeployed surveys to better understand the values of different residents and be more in-tune with the evolving local population.

Last year, the council launched a Community Plan initiative aimed at enabling engagement about residents’ aspirations for parts of the city which has seen the most rapid change. One of the key priorities of the programmes was to engage groups which had been under-represented in the council’s consultations, including the Roma community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince the announcement of the EU Settlement Scheme the council has aimed to mobilise this process to encourage more Roma residents to engage. To do so they are now offering face to face support for members of the Roma community using funding from the government’s Controlling Migration Fund. When Roma residents approach the council for advice and guidance on the scheme, staff carry out consultations on a range of issues which could inform Page Hall’s Community Plan. By gaining greater insight into the needs of an under-represented community, the aim is to ensure that the final plan genuinely reflects the aspirations of all residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"issues-to-consider--what-local-authorities-can-do-to-engage-with-communities\"\u003eIssues to consider – what local authorities can do to engage with communities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"understanding-the-landscape\"\u003eUnderstanding the landscape\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDoes the local authority have an up-to-date picture of its demographic make-up?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDoes the local authority carry out residents’ surveys or other exercises which could generate useful information on local attitudes and concerns?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHas there been research which could yield insights, including in similar local authorities?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAre there systems in place to ensure that intelligence from communities is being collected systematically, shared and analysed?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"building-relationships\"\u003eBuilding relationships\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHas the local authority mapped its key stakeholders in the community?

All local authorities will therefore be home to people who will need to apply for status under the EU Settlement Scheme. The scheme, which opened on 30 March 2019, also covers EEA and Swiss citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIrish citizens enjoy a right of residence in the UK that is not reliant on the UK’s membership of the EU, so they will not be required to apply for status under the scheme, but they may do so if they wish.

This has been a consequence of high levels of mobility, high levels of economic participation and relatively low take up of public services. This may, in some instances, have made it harder to establish strong links with some EU citizens. This is why some local authorities are also working in partnership with local charities, churches, schools and advice centres with close links to local EU citizen communities to build relationships.

However, one of the lessons from the 2016 EU referendum is that there should be no room for complacency. Figures from the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748598/hate-crime-1718-hosb2018.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHome Office’s hate crime bulletin\u003c/a\u003e from October 2018 showed that the number of racially or religiously aggravated offences recorded by the police rose significantly around the time of the EU referendum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire \u0026amp; Rescue Services published in July 2018 shows that incidents of hate crime ‘spike’ after national events. A similar increase is possible when the United Kingdom formally leaves the European Union. There may also be a risk of more localised trigger events which local authorities and their partners should be mindful of.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst this backdrop, regardless of the evidence, community concerns around hate crime may be heightened at this time. Fear of hate crime or the perception that there is an increased risk can be damaging too, regardless of whether there is any recorded or actual increase in the number of incidents. These anxieties might be heightened for some communities and it is crucial that partners recognise this and respond appropriately. It is also important to realise that relatively ‘minor’ crimes can attract significant attention because of the ‘signal’ they send to affected communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnsuring that hate crime is tackled and community tensions are minimised depends on proactive engagement and effective collaboration across government, both national and local, and with partner organisations and communities themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hate-crime-action-plan-2016\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecomprehensive plan for tackling hate crime\u003c/a\u003e which was refreshed in October 2018.

The likelihood of such events may be low, and they may be unrelated to Brexit, but as we prepare to leave the European Union it is entirely responsible and appropriate that local leaders continue to work closely to ensure full preparedness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough responses are likely to involve a wide range of actors – including central government, the police and groups in the community – local leaders, including local authorities, are the best placed to coordinate local responses. Local leaders play a key role in sharing timely and accurate information, often drawing from a wide range of sources across different agencies, both within and outside government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, response and communications may be coordinated through the Local Resilience Forum, particularly if there are concurrent events in the community. Local authorities are also members of multi-agency Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) and have duties to cooperate with partners in that forum. LRFs are doing some work to identify their own local planning assumptions for Brexit and determine any appropriate action they might need to take. Most LRF have completed scenario workshops focused on Brexit to identify risks and implement appropriate actions arising. They are also reviewing existing processes for collating and synthesising multi-agency information reports and for co-ordinating communications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePast experience shows that preparedness is critical because community reactions and the appearance and circulation of information across media can move very quickly. Incidents can quickly gain traction in the media and on social media platforms. Without a rapid and effective response in place, communities are more vulnerable to misinformation and narratives which can create uncertainty, and damage trust in local leaders and their partner organisations. A key aspect of preparing to respond to incidents is to have clear, reactive communications plans in place, drawing upon your existing links with your communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe check list below sets out some questions which local authorities and their partners may wish to ask themselves in seeking to strengthen existing communications plans to ensure they can respond rapidly and effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe nature of communications material will necessarily be dependent on the scenario but positive messaging affirming that local leaders and communities stand together in championing shared values can be effective in emphasising the strengths and assets of the local community. Through positive messages local leaders can call upon, galvanise and amplify local unity, and challenge behaviours and actions which stand in the way of community integration. It is critical however that local leaders remain sensitive to local concerns when constructing messages and identify where some content or language may not resonate well across their community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"issues-to-consider--preparing-for-an-incident-in-the-community\"\u003eIssues to consider – preparing for an incident in the community\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"coordination\"\u003eCoordination\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAre you clear about your authorities’ line of communication with central government?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIs there a platform to coordinate rapidly with the Local Resilience Forum, the police and key community leaders?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"media-strategy\"\u003eMedia strategy\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIs there a pre-prepared media plan which can be easily adapted and deployed in the case of a critical incident?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIs your database of local media contacts and local social media influencers up-to-date?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eHave you pre-agreed statements which can be rapidly adapted and shared via local press, social media and other channels?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eHave you agreed a command structure to ensure that statements can be tested and cleared as quickly as possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eDo you have contacts from a range of groups who are representative of the community (including young people, faith / minority communities)?

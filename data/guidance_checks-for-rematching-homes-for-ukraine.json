Councils will be required to undertake relevant DBS checks and accommodation checks in advance of move-on unless a move has already happened, in which case they should be completed retrospectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils are also expected to work through their existing multi-agency safeguarding partnerships to pool information they have. This is to ensure any risks have been picked up, for example, by agreeing the use of multi-agency safeguarding hubs or similar integrated teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind out more about \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/disclosure-and-barring-service-dbs-checks-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewhat DBS checks need to be made\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"accommodation-checks\"\u003eAccommodation checks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccommodation checks should be undertaken in alignment with existing guidance for councils on checks to be completed as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The only difference is that these should be completed prior to the arrival of guests wherever possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can read the full \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accommodation-checks-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on accommodation checks\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-checks-raise-a-concern\"\u003eIf checks raise a concern\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a council assesses that a sponsor is unsuitable, they should record this information as soon as possible on the Foundry case management system (CMS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe guest should not move into the accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the council’s responsibility to notify the sponsor and guest, taking care to take appropriate data protection measures. Where the sponsor refuses to undergo checks or the checks record that they are unsuitable, the guest should be made aware and advised to move out. If the guest chooses to stay, the council should make clear to the guest that this is at their own risk and the host will not get the thank you payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSafeguarding must remain an essential consideration and Ukrainian guests who do not wish to be formally rematched should be made aware by the local authority how to report any future concerns to their council or the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils must also assess whether rematches are between close family members.  Since 1 October 2024, sponsors/hosts of new arrivals are not eligible to receive thank you payments for sponsoring a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/homes-for-ukraine-council-guides\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eclose member of their family\u003c/a\u003e who moves into their home.  Those who are already in the UK and move in with a close family member are classified as having left the HfU scheme, rather than a rematch.  In these cases, local authorities are not required to carry out the usual HfU safeguarding checks, however statutory duties still apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis change applies to payment claims taking place from 1 October 2024, irrespective of visa application dates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind out what to do \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/if-checks-raise-a-concern-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eif checks raise a concern\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"welfare-checks\"\u003eWelfare checks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the guests’ arrival with their new host, councils should confirm as soon as possible that the guest is well, and that there are no welfare concerns or needs for care and support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere there are concerns for the safety or welfare of a child, councils should follow their usual processes in line with guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eworking together to safeguard children\u003c/a\u003e which may include further assessments. Where it is suspected that an adult may have care and support needs, a needs assessment should be undertaken in line with the requirements of the Care Act 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils are expected to make at least one in-person visit once the guest has arrived with their new host. This welfare check enables the council to see whether there are any welfare concerns or formal assessments that should be undertake. Before undertaking the visit, the council can choose to review their local intelligence, if any, on the sponsor household, in line with pages 18-22 of guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eworking together to safeguard children\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on Information sharing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWelfare checks are particularly important for vulnerable groups such as lone young adults, for example an 18 or 19-year-old who is in the UK without any family members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs above, all checks within the Foundry case management system (CMS) must have been completed before the council begins the process of issuing the sponsor payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead the full guidance about what \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/welfare-checks-and-follow-up-visits-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewelfare checks\u003c/a\u003e are needed and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

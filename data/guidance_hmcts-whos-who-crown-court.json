The defendant sits in the dock and sometimes a uniformed officer sits next to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-defence-lawyer\"\u003eThe defence lawyer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe defence lawyer will speak on behalf of the defendant and present the case to say why they’re not guilty of the offence. They’ll ask the witnesses and the defendant questions about the accusations. The defence lawyer sometimes wears a wig and gown. Sometimes a defendant will represent themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-prosecutor\"\u003eThe prosecutor\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutor is a lawyer who presents the case independently on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service.

The judge wears a wig and gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-jury\"\u003eThe jury\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe jury is made up of 12 members of the public.

The usher wears a black gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-pressmedia\"\u003eThe press/media\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe media can attend most court hearings by law. This includes those with reporting restrictions in place. A key part of open justice is the reporting of hearings by the media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-public\"\u003eThe public\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crown Court is usually open to the public.

There has been some progress since then but the job of modernising the process has proved more challenging than envisaged and one that no single institution can achieve on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the view of a newly formed coalition of government and industry partners – the Digital Property Market Steering Group (DPMSG) – representing an important coming together of key industry partners under a shared vision at a pivotal time for the property market. The group’s purpose is to help the property market work better for all by accelerating the adoption of digital technology, while ensuring it is transparent, secure and consumer friendly, through collaboration and innovation across the sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDPMSG has representation from key areas of the sector where there is likely to be the greatest potential for accelerated digital adoption. This includes legal property professionals, surveyors, conveyancers, lenders and estate agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dpmsg-founding-members\"\u003eDPMSG founding members\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLaw Society\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConveyancing Association (CA)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCouncil for Licensed Conveyancers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe Society of Licensed Conveyancers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSolicitors Regulation Authority\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eChartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEX)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCILEx Regulation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCouncil of Property Search Organisations\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePropertymark\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eBuilding Societies Association\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUK Finance\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHM Land Registry\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dpmsg-vision\"\u003eDPMSG vision\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe want everyone involved in buying, leasing and selling land and property to experience a secure and modern market that is transparent, customer-friendly and business-friendly at all stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough collaboration, innovation and a focus on emerging digital technologies we will build on existing progress across the home buying and selling system to get a better result for the customer: simpler, faster, more certain and less stressful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLubna Shuja, President of the Law Society of England and Wales said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe Law Society is committed to improving the home-buying experience for consumers and others involved in the conveyancing process.

It will bring together leaders and influencers from across the sector to set a clear direction for a secure and modern land and property market, explore the barriers to change and demonstrate joint leadership and commitment among participants to taking forward this programme of transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 300 invited guests will attend from across the property market sectors including estate agents, surveyors, conveyancers, financial, software providers, data providers, panel managers, Proptech and other groups key to driving change. HM Land Registry, Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) and Geospatial Commission officials will also attend. Those participating will share insights on social media using #DigitalPropertyMarket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe membership and shared vision of DPMSG means it is well placed to join up with the delivery activity being led by other groups who share the same ambition for a better property market including the Home Buying and Selling Group (HBSG). This joined up approach is reflected in the co-hosting of the launch event by Kate Faulkner OBE, Chair of the HBSG and Mike Harlow, HM Land Registry’s Deputy Chief Executive. DPMSG will focus on the adoption of digital technology through collaboration and innovation across both residential and commercial land and property markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDPMSG will also soon launch a new podcast series – Property with a View – hosted by Mike Harlow, HM Land Registry’s Deputy Chief Executive and Director of Customer and Strategy. Mike will speak with leaders across the sector as a way of exploring what changes need to happen and how the market can work together to achieve them. The programme of content will feature leaders from all corners of the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

                    "body":  "\u003cdiv class=\"govspeak\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eHMRC is aware of tax avoidance arrangements used by owner managed companies and their directors. These arrangements are used to reward a director for the services they provide to a company, in a way that seeks to avoid paying Income Tax and National Insurance contributions, while the company obtains Corporation Tax relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHMRC believes these arrangements do not work. We will seek to challenge anyone promoting or using these arrangements to make sure they pay the correct tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrangements involve a company creating an unfunded pension obligation to pay one or more of their directors a pension. This step attempts to create an expense in the company accounts to reduce the company’s profits and the amount of Corporation Tax payable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsers of these arrangements may pay considerable fees to use them. Yet, could still have to repay the tax claimed to be avoided, as well as interest and a penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-the-arrangements-claim-to-work\"\u003eHow the arrangements claim to work\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company enters into an agreement with its director to give that director the rights to receive a pension from the company in the future. However, due to the structure of the arrangements, HMRC believes the director will never receive a pension payment. The company then claims a Corporation Tax deduction equal to the current value of the total future pension to be paid to the director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany arrangements may involve further steps, such as one considered by the General Anti-Abuse Rule (\u003cabbr title=\"General anti-abuse rule\"\u003eGAAR\u003c/abbr\u003e) Advisory Panel. The \u003cabbr title=\"General anti-abuse rule\"\u003eGAAR\u003c/abbr\u003e is an independent advisory panel which approves HMRC’s General Anti Abuse Rule (\u003cabbr title=\"General anti-abuse rule\"\u003eGAAR\u003c/abbr\u003e) guidance. They provide opinions on cases where HMRC considers the \u003cabbr title=\"General anti-abuse rule\"\u003eGAAR\u003c/abbr\u003e may apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe further step considered by \u003cabbr title=\"General anti-abuse rule\"\u003eGAAR\u003c/abbr\u003e is where the company transfers its obligation to pay the director a pension in the future to a third party. The third party is often a relative of the director or another director of the same company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company agrees to make a payment to that third party, so the third party, instead of the company, agree to pay the director a pension. This payment may be made to the third party, or the third party can ask for a payment to be made to the director instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese arrangements claim to result in the director, or a third party linked to the director, receiving funds from the company. The funds have no immediate liability to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the tax effect, these arrangements often result in unusual outcomes. For example, a spouse agreeing to pay their partner a pension without receiving anything in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/general-anti-abuse-rule-advisory-panel\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"General anti-abuse rule\"\u003eGAAR\u003c/abbr\u003e Advisory Panel\u003c/a\u003e has given its opinion on a set of arrangements by which a company rewarded its director through an unfunded pension obligation.

HMRC will challenge anyone promoting such arrangements and investigate the tax affairs of all users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA company that uses these arrangements is unlikely to be able to claim the Corporation Tax relief intended. This is because the expense shown in the company accounts may not align with general accepted accounting principles (\u003cabbr title=\"generally accepted accounting principles\"\u003eGAAP\u003c/abbr\u003e). The expense may also be disallowed for other reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eArrangements may involve transferring the obligation to a third party.

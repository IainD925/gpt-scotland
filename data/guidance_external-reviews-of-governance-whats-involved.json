Local tier governance can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of a school, and it would be helpful to review the relationship between the local tier and the board, and how effective communication and direction are.

While they must ensure they do not stray into undertaking the academy trustees’ role, they should assure themselves that the governance of the academy trust is effective, that academy trustees are acting in accordance with the academy trust’s charitable object(s) and that they, the members, use their powers to step in if governance is failing. The review of an academy trust board should consider how effectively trust members exercise their responsibilities, and how they are assured that the academy trust board is exercising effective governance. The review may need to include interviews with some members to talk through their role and how they feel they contribute effectively. It may also be useful to test the degree of involvement or overlap with the board, and assure the academy trust of an appropriate degree of separation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther advice on the role of members is available in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAcademy trust handbook\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-structures-and-roles\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAcademy trust governance: structures and roles\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"relationship-with-stakeholders\"\u003eRelationship with stakeholders\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor some organisations it will be highly valuable to assess the board’s interactions with a range of key stakeholders.

Appropriate input from the reviewer aids a clear understanding of the rationale for the recommended actions, but joint working promotes ownership for its implementation as the board will be responsible for implementing the plan. Like all action plans, it should be timebound, specific and identify clear measures of success, and should cover how gaps in knowledge and skill will be addressed. Boards must also consider their capacity to implement change and whether further support will be needed to help ensure the recommendations from the review are implemented in a timely and effective way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"progress-and-follow-up-review\"\u003eProgress and follow-up review\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may be helpful to invite the reviewer to return after several months to help assess the boards progress against an action plan. It is an opportunity to review how well improvements are being implemented, respond to any changes, and seek further advice. If you wish to include a follow up visit, this will need to be considered in the cost of the review. Reviewers can offer ongoing support to a board to support the effective delivery of action plans. However, it is important to ensure the reviewer’s independence is maintained, and the reviewer does not become too close to the board or any of its members - this role should be that of a ‘critical friend’ rather than of a mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

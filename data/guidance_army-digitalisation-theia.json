This includes two pilots: a) Building Efficiency Management System (BEMS) to manage energy efficiency and reduce carbon output in Catterick; and, b) a networked digital signage, 5G and SmartBase technology pilot in Larkhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArmy Estate Wide Open Internet access:\u003c/strong\u003e  The ubiquitous provision of open broad band internet access (via WiFi) across the Army Estate is totemic to THEIA Digital Transformation and reflects increasing reliance on personal internet access for work purposes – not least training, education and routine management.  It will initially include 400 army sites with the aim to extend it to all 498 sites across three distinct areas (business, welfare and single living accommodation).  The intention is to further extend it to the Defence Training Estate where it will enable live/simulated training benefit to training audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment Information Exploitation:\u003c/strong\u003e  This will enable accurate planning and monitoring of Army fleet maintenance and sustainment. The Babcock delivered Armoured Fighting Vehicle condition monitoring trial seeks potential savings of 10% of the £100-million running costs and will dramatically increase vehicle availability and reduce costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Army Personnel Processes:\u003c/strong\u003e  The Army digital team have already built the Army Career Management Tool; automating manual paper-based processes into a suite of digital-integrated workflows to conduct promotion and selection boards. Since Jun 2020, 291 promotion boards have been conducted using the tool – giving the career managers more time to focus on the individual needs of the soldiers and officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFoundation of Digital Skills:\u003c/strong\u003e  More than half of UK adults do not have the essential digital skills needed for the workplace.  This accelerator will upskill the workforce to have the skills to adapt to the fast-paced advances in technology and be leaders in the digital age. Focus in the short term is on analysing and mapping the training need to deliver high-quality, relevant individual and collective digital skills from foundation to specialist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigitalising the Field Army:\u003c/strong\u003e  The Field Army Information Exploitation team are drawing previously dissipated data together to provide a dynamic understanding of readiness, deployability and availability for the Land Operations Command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTHEIA will enable the Army to be transformative in an era of persistent competition.  It will also improve our integration with industry, partners and allies.  This will underpin our ambitions to be a significant contributor to HMG’s Global Britain strategy, and deliver CGS’ “asymmetric Army for the Digital Age”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"context\"\u003eContext\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Integrated Review was the largest review of the UK’s foreign, defence, security and development policy since the end of the Cold War. Information-based capabilities that can demonstrate effect now, such as cyber and Information Operations, are likely to be highly valued, both offensively and defensively. Moreover, in an era of persistent competition, the ability to deter, disrupt and demoralise potential adversaries by leveraging and integrating nuanced defence and security options is increasingly important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKvachkov, Vladimir, Russian Special Purpose Forces IN Keir Giles, Handbook of Russian Information Warfare (Rome: NATO Defense College, Fellowship Monograph, 2016) says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eA new type of war has emerged, in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the military and political objectives of war to another kind of warfare – Information War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is clear is the demands of the contemporary operating environment and the Integrated Review require Defence to integrate across all five domains (Land, Sea, Air, Space, Information), with other Services, government departments and allies and provide reach, speed of response and agility. Equally there is a requirement for new and cutting-edge technology to keep pace with adversaries. However, to compete in Information Warfare and widely integrate effects requires Defence to do more than simply buy new technology. It needs to conduct a digital transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"integration-is-the-future\"\u003eIntegration is the future\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinal words from the Army’s Chief Information Officer (CIO), Director Information, General JJ Cole in his speech to \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rusi.org/event/rusi-integrating-information-manoeuvre-conference\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRUSI Integrating Information Manoeuvre Conference\u003c/a\u003e, 10 Mar 2020:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Let us be bold: There is no Integrated Action without Information Advantage.

Since January, protection against symptomatic COVID, 4 weeks after the first dose, ranged between 57 and 61% for one dose of Pfizer and between 60 and 73% for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pre-print article:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecompares the rate of vaccination in symptomatic people aged over 70 years of age who test positive for COVID-19, compared to those who test negative\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecompares the rate of hospitalisation in confirmed COVID-19 cases aged over 80 who were vaccinated more than 14 days before testing positive, compared to unvaccinated cases\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecompares the rate of deaths in confirmed COVID-19 cases aged over 80 who were vaccinated with Pfizer vaccine more than 14 days before testing positive, compared to unvaccinated cases\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the over 80s, data suggest that a single dose of either vaccine is more than 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation, around 3 to 4 weeks after the jab.

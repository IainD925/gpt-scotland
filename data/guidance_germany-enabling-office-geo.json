For example, personal support with immigration status and identification, registering private vehicles, and providing tax advice - through to the more strategic requirements of enabling military equipment and personnel to operate in and through Germany.

Subsequently, the NATO SOFA was ratified and brought into service in 1951.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of the NATO SOFA is to deliver a foundational legal framework setting out common measures for the presence and operation of one nation state’s (‘sending state’) military in the territory of another nation state (‘receiving state’). The agreement allows for further refined bilateral or multilateral arrangements to be developed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of a further refined multilateral agreement is the Supplementary Agreement in Germany. The agreement was signed in 1959 at Bonn by the United Kingdom’s Ambassador to West Germany, Sir Christopher Steel. At this time he was also the permanent UK representative to NATO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK has maintained its membership since inception. From 1959 to September 2019 the British Army provided the United Kingdom’s military mission in Germany through bases and was responsible for the conduct of the whole of defence in Germany under the terms of the agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2010 it was determined that the British Army would withdraw from Germany as a base. Withdrawal was concluded in September 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2012 the United Kingdom retained membership of the Supplementary Agreement in Germany in recognition of its strategic value and acknowledged the requirement for a UK military mission in Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe military mission transferred to operate under the then Joint Forces Command, now United Kingdom Strategic Command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Germany Enabling Office officially assumed the responsible and accountable role on behalf of UK Defence on 23 September 2019 and continues to deliver it today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"related-content\"\u003eRelated content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-defence-in-germany-and-europe-information-notes\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Defence in Germany - Information notes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sofa\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNATO Status of Forces Agreement - identification of status\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spousal-employment-nato-sofa\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSpousal employment - NATO Status of Forces Agreement and Supplementary Agreement Germany\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact\"\u003eContact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmail: \u003ca href=\"mailto:GSO-GEO-CmdGrp@mod.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGSO-GEO-CmdGrp@mod.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

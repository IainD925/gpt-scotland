Objectives\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis UK-wide grassroots football and multi-sport facilities programme aims to deliver the pitches every community needs. The government has announced £205m over the next three years, with this ambition in mind. The programme is likely to have four broad objectives, subject to agreement with Ministers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto increase participation in sport, improving the mental and physical health of participants\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto increase the number of multi-sport facilities in the country to boost participation in non-football sport\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto reduce the postcode lottery for quality facilities by directing at least 50% of investment into deprived areas, and boost participation in these places\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto deliver improved access to sport facilities for women and girls (100% equal access), and other under-represented groups, to increase participation in these groups.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn England in the 2021/22 financial year,, the programme is being delivered by the Football Foundation, the UK’s largest sport’s charity and the existing delivery partner for the National Football Facilities Plan. They work with local areas to deliver Local Football Facility Plans in each area, based on their needs. n Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the Football Associations are delivering this year’s funding. Decisions are yet to be taken on the delivery partners and objectives for the next phase of the programme from 2022/23 onwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are potentially seeking an organisation to lead the local coordination, assessment and management of bids for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from an organisation with experience in these areas (though they do not necessarily need to be based there - a grassroots sport charity or community organisation, a sport body with the ability to make grants, or another appropriate body could also express interest). We are seeking to understand whether there is capacity and capability in the market for a grant manager/s for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - we will consider applications on an individual basis (i.e. a different grant maker could be appointed in each area) or a combined approach (where one or more areas are covered by the same grant making body).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"capital-delivery-timetable\"\u003e2.

Grant intermediary role\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are assessing interest from potential Grant making bodies to manage the delivery of the grassroots programme in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This organisation should have experience in grant delivery, capital in particular, as well as in depth knowledge of the football and multi-sports facilities sector. The Grant manager will need to demonstrate experience of technical assessment and timely management of capital projects, and the ability to work with local and national stakeholders to deliver grassroots projects in line with government objectives. Our expectation is that one organisation would deliver in each of the areas - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, we would also welcome applications from any organisation who could deliver across multiple jurisdictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grant manager may be awarded a grant to cover some of the costs associated with the delivery of this funding. However, this is not confirmed - no funding has currently been allocated for this from existing settlements. Applicants should set out in their response what resource they would require and it’s cost, but this does not guarantee that said funding will be made available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grant manager will be required to agree with DCMS and deliver:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea) a framework for assessing and monitoring capital bids,\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eb) Management of all applicant and grant offer documentation,\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe running of any necessary governance arrangements in their area e.g. assessment panels.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will also likely report into some form of programme management or oversight board in DCMS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\" class=\"cell-text-center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhase\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\" class=\"cell-text-center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActivity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd class=\"cell-text-center\"\u003e1.

DCMS would therefore consider interest from an organisation who only wanted to deliver in one of these areas, and met the criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact-details\"\u003e5.

Awaab’s Law will set new requirements on social landlords, including timescales for repairs, to ensure they are taking swift action to address dangerous hazards such as damp and mould. This consultation will be open until 5 March 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it closes, we will consider the responses before bringing Awaab’s Law into force through secondary legislation (regulations) as soon as we can.

It will also mean providers must have a code of conduct which their staff must follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, it will require senior managers and executives working in the social housing sector to gain a qualification in housing management.

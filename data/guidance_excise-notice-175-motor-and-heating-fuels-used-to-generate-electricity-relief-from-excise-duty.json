This then sets the extent to which it’s eligible to receive fiscal and other benefits. For Climate Change Levy, for example, it will set the extent to which both the input fuel used in the combined heat and power station and the corresponding outputs (direct and self-supplies of qualifying power output electricity) are relieved of Climate Change Levy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor full relief on input fuel, a station needs to achieve, or better, the efficiency percentage threshold of 20%. When this criterion is not met, relief from Climate Change Levy is scaled back. This is calculated by applying the ‘relevant fraction’, the ratio between a station’s efficiency percentage and the threshold efficiency percentage, to supplies made to the station. A combined heat and power station is able to claim relief on oils used to generate outputs for an annual operation scaled back to the same relevant fraction as entitlement to relief from Climate Change Levy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCombined heat and power stations in Great Britain will also need to account for carbon price support rates of fuel duty on oil that’s referable to the production of electricity.

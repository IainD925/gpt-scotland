During Storm Christoph, the embankment separating Lunt Meadows from the River Alt was badly damaged by the pressure of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Agency now plan to temporally fill the breach using up to 500 bags of aggregate. Pumps will also be used to get additional water out the reservoir so the damage can be better assessed.  A helicopter will be used to fly the bags of aggregate and additional pumps over to the breach with the work expecting to take up to six days to fully complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOfficers from the Environment Agency have undertaken on-site inspections to ensure the repair works do not cause any risk to the local wildlife on the nature reserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"andy-brown-flood-and-coastal-risk-manager-for-lancashire-said\"\u003eAndy Brown, Flood and Coastal Risk Manager for Lancashire said:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring Storm Christoph we worked successfully with emergency responders and partner organisations including United Utilities, Sefton Council and Lancashire Wildlife Trust, in response to what was forecast to be the heaviest rainfall for decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Thankfully, on this occasion, the flood storage area at Lunt Meadows absorbed the excess flows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“While our emergency response to this incident has now been stood down, the repair to the damage on one of the River Alt’s embankments is now our top priority. This will allow us to fully restore the protection offered by the flood storage area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We fully appreciate the impact incidents like these have on people and we will continue to work alongside our partners to bring these repair works to a positive conclusion. We do encourage members of the community not to try and attend the site while works are taking place as there will be a large amount of heavy plant machinery operation in progress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"bill-esterson-mp-for-sefton-central-and-shadow-minister-for-international-trade-said\"\u003eBill Esterson MP for Sefton Central and Shadow Minister for International Trade said:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you to the Environment Agency for carrying out these vital repairs. As climate change increases the risk of future flooding events, Maghull must be better protected. I will continue to work with the Environment Agency and other agencies to urgently explore further solutions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n",

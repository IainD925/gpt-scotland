Compulsory purchase powers can support the delivery of a range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects in the public interest. In doing so, they can help to bring about improvements to social, economic and environmental wellbeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.\tAlthough compulsory purchase powers can help to deliver positive change, the government recognises that it can be upsetting and stressful to discover that land which you own or occupy is to be compulsorily acquired. Furthermore, the law and procedures relating to compulsory purchase are complex, which can be daunting. This series of 4 plain English guides is intended to help those affected by compulsory purchase by explaining how the system works in simple terms. The guides reflect legislative changes up to and including the Neighbourhood Planning Act 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.\tBefore reading this guide, you should first read \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/compulsory-purchase-and-compensation-guide-1-procedure\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuide 1\u003c/a\u003e which provides an end-to-end overview of the compulsory purchase order (\u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e) process in England and Wales. It outlines the procedures which acquiring authorities must go through to use their powers and explains what opportunities those affected have to influence the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.\tThis guide – Guide 4 – deals solely with the issue of compensation for residential owners and occupiers affected by a \u003cabbr title=\"compulsory purchase order\"\u003eCPO\u003c/abbr\u003e. Other guides in the series explain rights to compensation for business owners and occupiers (\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/compulsory-purchase-and-compensation-guide-2-compensation-to-business-owners-and-occupiers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuide 2\u003c/a\u003e) and for agricultural owners and occupiers (\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/compulsory-purchase-and-compensation-guide-3-compensation-to-agricultural-owners-and-occupiers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuide 3\u003c/a\u003e). The compensation and valuation principles explained in these guides apply to all compulsory purchase schemes, regardless of the type of legal instrument being used: this includes CPOs, Transport and Works Act Orders (TWAOs), development consent orders (DCOs) and Hybrid Acts of Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.\tThese guides are aimed at the layperson. and wherever possible, the use of jargon and technical language has been avoided. There are, however, a number of important terms which have specific meaning in compulsory purchase matters. These words and expressions are explained within \u003ca href=\"#link_appendix1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAppendix 1\u003c/a\u003e of this guide. There are also a number of bodies and organisations who may be able to offer their advice if you are affected by compulsory purchase.

The information they contain carries no legal force and does not constitute legal advice. The guides are not a substitute for professional advice. If you think your land may be the subject of compulsory purchase you should seek advice from a suitably experienced property adviser such as a chartered surveyor, an agricultural valuer or a solicitor, who should be able to advise on your rights and also act on your behalf if appropriate.

You should also keep detailed records of all expenses incurred and losses sustained as you may be able to recover these as part of your claim for compensation. You should bear in mind that you can only receive compensation for expenses and losses which occur as a direct and reasonable consequence of the acquisition of your land.

This means that you need to take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce your losses. For example, if you need to employ a removals firm to assist with your move, you should obtain quotes from at least 2 reputable firms. Assuming the firms all offer the same service, instructing the cheapest would be a way of mitigating your loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"outline-of-the-compensation-system\"\u003eOutline of the compensation system\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e12.\tThis guide provides a description of the statutory framework for compensation.

Your professional adviser will be able to advise if any such schemes exist and are relevant to your particular case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e13.\tThe rights to compensation for those affected by compulsory purchase - and the procedures for assessing the correct amount – are governed by a combination of legislation, case law and established practice. These are sometimes referred to collectively as the ‘compensation code’. However, there is no single, published document called the compensation code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e14.\tThe overriding principle of compulsory purchase compensation is ‘equivalence’.

For example, even though only a small part of the garden of a house may be acquired for a new road, the loss of amenity due to noise, fumes, vibration, loss of view, etc resulting from the use of the road may reduce the value of the property further.

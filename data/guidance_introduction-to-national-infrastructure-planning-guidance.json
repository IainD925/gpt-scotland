The DCO not only provides consent for the project but may also incorporate other consents and licences and may include authorisation for the compulsory acquisition of land (if certain tests are met). The DCO will specify the details of the development consented and any requirements (similar to planning conditions) that must be met in implementing the consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 001   Reference ID: 01-001-20240417\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePublished: 17/04/2024\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-role-of-national-infrastructure-planning-guidance\"\u003eWhat is the role of National Infrastructure Planning Guidance?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe NSIP consenting process introduced by the Planning Act has been in operation now for over a decade, and several changes to it have been made in that time. To support the legislation, a range of guidance documents have been issued by the former Department for Communities and Local Government and successor departments. As part of operational reforms to make the NSIP consenting process faster, more transparent and easier for all stakeholders to navigate, National Infrastructure Planning Guidance (“guidance”) has been comprehensively reviewed and updated. This takes into account the experience gained from handling a large number of applications for development consent. It also provides additional guidance to support those new legislative measures, processes and practices that have been introduced as part of the NSIP reforms.    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe revised guidance reflects knowledge of good practice, changing circumstances and feedback from users on its clarity and helpfulness. It has been developed with input from across government, industry, and a wide range of stakeholders, and builds on responses received as part of the government’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/operational-reforms-to-the-nationally-significant-infrastructure-project-consenting-process/consultation-on-operational-reforms-to-the-nationally-significant-infrastructure-project-consenting-process\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econsultation on the operational reform of the NSIP process in 2023\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe format of the guidance adopts similar approaches to the Planning Practice Guidance that supports the National Planning Policy Framework. This enables more frequent updates to reflect changes to the system and build on experience gained as reforms to the process take effect. This includes a move towards a webpage format to provide greater searchability, consistency and accessibility across guidance for all users of the system.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe revised guidance is structured around the main stages involved in preparing an NSIP:    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 1 – Pre-application\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 2 – Acceptance\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 3 – Pre-examination\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 4 – Examination\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 5 – Recommendation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 6 – Decision\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eStage 7 – Post Decision\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther guidance supplements and explains in further detail particular aspects of the National Infrastructure Planning process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFast-Track\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eContent of a Development Consent Order\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFees, Cost Recovery \u0026amp; Planning Performance Agreements\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCompulsory Acquisition\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNSIPs and Housing\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eProcess for carrying out a review of existing National Policy Statements\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGlossary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach new guidance section explains where existing guidance has been superseded, otherwise the existing guidance remains valid.

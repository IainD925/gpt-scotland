Distributions are treated for tax purposes in the same way as dividends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the other 2 cases, the tribunal decided that both the trust contributions and scheme fees were not an allowable expense for tax purposes. In those 2 cases the tribunal also decided that loans paid to the individuals from the trust were a form of disguised remuneration on which Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Income Tax and National Insurance contributions were due.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the tribunal decisions, all 3 companies that used the scheme need to pay significantly more in taxes than if they had not entered into a remuneration trust tax avoidance scheme.

They do not have to be Ukrainian citizens to be eligible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor applications submitted after 3pm on 19 February 2024, eligible applicants may be sponsored by people who are British or Irish Citizens or settled in the UK (which means having the right to live in the UK permanently).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of people who can access this scheme is uncapped and is dependent on the capacity of the sponsors who come forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuests will be able to live and work in the UK until their permission to stay expires and access benefits, healthcare, employment, and other support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose arriving need to meet standard security checks prior to being issued with a visa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSponsors and all adults in sponsors’ households will also be subject to initial Police National Computer (PNC), criminal records and Warnings Index checks by the Home Office. Guests arriving from Ireland should only travel to the UK once they have a visa. If a sponsor is a Ukraine scheme visa holder, there may be some delays to applications while further checks are undertaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"northern-ireland-scotland-and-wales\"\u003eNorthern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuests arriving from Ireland should only travel to the UK once they have a visa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-for-ukrainians/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eScotland\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gov.wales/wales-super-sponsor\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWales\u003c/a\u003e, people from Ukraine can also enter through the Devolved Government Sponsorship route. New applications to both the Scottish Government and Welsh Government as a sponsor are paused at present but all existing applications to both schemes are continuing to be processed, and existing visa holders continue to travel to Wales and be supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"application-process\"\u003eApplication process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSponsors must be named individuals at this stage of the scheme, not groups or organisations. Either a guest or a sponsor will be able to complete a single application for a visa. The form will ask the person completing it to name both parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSponsors and guests will find each other and match themselves externally. There is no single route to matching, and both the sponsor and guest can use several ways s to find a match. They could for example already have a relationship in place with a friend in the UK or Ukraine, they could be friends of friends, or could find a sponsor or guest through a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), charity, or another channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"process-to-apply\"\u003eProcess to apply\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSponsor and guest find each other and agree to a match.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEither the sponsor or the guest fills out the single visa application form online using both parties’ details.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePassport numbers (alongside completion of eligibility questions and other personal details) for both guests and sponsors will be required to complete the application online. The guest will also need to upload a scan of their passport.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAs of 7 December 2023, all new applicants will need to book an appointment to have their photograph and fingerprints taken at a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003evisa application centre (VAC)\u003c/a\u003e as part of their application. Security checks on both the sponsor and guest are commissioned from the name data declared in the application form. There is no requirement to upload a copy of identity documents for any other member of the sponsor household.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe government will conduct several central government checks on the applicant, the sponsor, and adults in the sponsors household, to ensure their eligibility and suitability for the scheme. These checks must be completed before a visa can be issued.  If a sponsor is a Ukraine scheme visa holder, however, there may be some delays to applications while further checks are undertaken.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOnce the visa is issued, the guest can then travel to the UK and should coordinate their arrival with the sponsor.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLocal councils will be alerted as soon as an application is made and will be required to conduct accommodation and safeguarding checks, These are in addition to the checks carried out by central government. These should be conducted as soon as possible, but the issuance of a visa is not contingent on these checks being completed.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSpecific councils will provide welcome arrangements for guests, with additional immediate support provided to guests where it is required (see initial reception role of councils below).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA lead sponsor will be needed for each household.

If the visa has yet to be issued, failed checks will prevent the application progressing and prevent further visas associated with that sponsor from being issued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities are also advised to report broader concerns or emerging patterns with regards to non-consenting sponsors to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and raise with the National Fraud \u0026amp; Cyber Crime Reporting Centre at \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAction Fraud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-do-in-suspected-cases-of-fraud\"\u003eWhat to do in suspected cases of fraud\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the local authority identifies cases where guests have been asked to pay for their visa, travel or immigration documentation by an individual or third-party group they should refer the case to Action Fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the local authority identifies cases in which a person’s information has been used without their permission, or duplicated across multiple applications, they should ensure the sponsor is marked as unsuitable, and each guest attached to that sponsor amended to show accommodation fail. As much information as possible should be supplied when updating the case in this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a local authority identifies a case where a Ukrainian guest possesses forged, false or counterfeit visas or travel documentation, they should contact the Home Office.

They will need to complete an in-UK application for permission to remain and provide their biometrics to receive the remainder of 36 months permission to remain from their date of arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"arriving-in-the-uk\"\u003eArriving in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUpon arrival to the UK, guests will be required to show their permission to travel letter or passport with vignette to Border Force officers.

The \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e’s 65,000 civil service staff support the armed forces in all sorts of ways. They make a real difference to the country’s defence effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen staff join and plan their performance, move jobs, develop their skills, receive their pay, adjust their working patterns, or leave, it is our services they will use. When personal issues of health, welfare or conduct arise, it is our advisers who will guide them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we are not just a place where transactions are done. We are here to help the \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e put people first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy creating an organisation and pulling all people services together, from joining to leaving, we will help the people programme in its broader goal of transforming how we work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many other providers of personnel services, and we will face strong competition. The wider government agenda for shared services means that only the best and most efficient providers, public or private sector, will survive. We have no automatic right to be the provider of these services to the \u003cabbr title=\"Ministry of Defence\"\u003eMOD\u003c/abbr\u003e or any other customer. Across government, shared services will tend to converge around the best providers. So our goal is simple: to be one of those best providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a professional and committed team, proud of the services they provide, and are confident that we will create the service our customers deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"people-service-centre\"\u003ePeople Service Centre\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor enquiries on your pay, miscellaneous claims (ie. for short terms detached duty) and HR related enquiries (such as position management changes, recruitment enquiries and training and development enquiries) your first point of contact would be the People Service Centre (\u003cabbr title=\"People Service Centre\"\u003ePSC\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is estimated that the \u003cabbr title=\"People Service Centre\"\u003ePSC\u003c/abbr\u003e will handle in excess of a million calls per year.

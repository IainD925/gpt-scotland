The \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Data Strategy\u003c/a\u003e (NDS) describes the potential of government data. Data drives informed decision-making, beneficial policy and effective public services. Public bodies record, hold and process data to carry out a wide range of functions and deliver services for people. To realise the many benefits that data can provide, the government needs to change the way data is used, reused and shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, it is common for different parts of government to adopt or create standards for recording, managing, using and sharing data according to their specific needs and challenges. This can mean that the ways different parts of government work are inconsistent and incompatible with data exchange and reuse. The government needs to take a more coordinated and centralised approach to fixing its data foundations. This is one of the five mission priorities in the NDS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData standards are fundamental to improving how government shares, integrates and uses data. Data standards set a clear and common understanding of how the government must describe, record, store, manage and access data in consistent ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has recognised the need to improve data standards. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/data-standards-authority\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eData Standards Authority\u003c/a\u003e (DSA) was established in April 2020. It is led by the Cabinet Office in close partnership with the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The DSA leads cross-government work on data standards to support the sharing and interoperability of data in government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are complex fiscal, political, technological and operational challenges in government the DSA needs to balance to achieve a cultural shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChanging how government uses data is an opportunity for the DSA to strengthen existing processes, encourage the adoption of standards and build on existing standards. Responses to the NDS and the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ma.nttdata.com/civil-service-data-research\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCivil Service Data Survey 2021\u003c/a\u003e shows widespread support for a greater focus on data standards and an authority to lead government-wide adoption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DSA needs to make sure that proposed and implemented data standards fully meet user needs, and can meet future demands. The DSA does this by collaborating with experts from a wide range of organisations, including the public sector, private sector and academia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGovernment uses data in many ways, so the DSA must make strategic decisions to prioritise which aspects to standardise. The DSA works closely with other related areas of work such as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-data-quality-hub\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGovernment Data Quality Hub\u003c/a\u003e, ONS \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/category/integrated-data-programme/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eIntegrated Data Programme\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDigital Economy Act 2017\u003c/a\u003e’s data sharing powers, open data and data ethics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis strategy sets out the role, vision and priorities of the DSA.

The DSA works to understand the scale of this challenge in a wider government context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DSA works closely with other related areas of work such as the Government Data Quality Hub, as well as major data-enabled projects such as the Integrated Data Programme and GOV.UK Accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe simplest definition of a data standard is a set of shared rules by which data can be described, recorded or transported. The DSA provides standards that support data interoperability. Data interoperability addresses how systems and services that create, exchange and consume data have clear, shared expectations for the contents, context and meaning of that data. Data interoperability is important to improve broader interoperability across government, or to allow one system to interact with another system within or across organisations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of data interoperability include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eenabling delivery of more joined-up digital services for public and businesses\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eboosting efficiency, for example interoperable data in the cross-government property, commercial, HR and finance functions helps to identify waste and make back office functions more efficient\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eenabling better analytics and business insights, which can drive continuous improvement\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ereducing the time it takes to have meaningful conversations between providers and consumers of data\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eincreasing engagement with citizens and the private sector for better policy outcomes\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ereducing silos of work and increasing reuse of data and services teams and departments have in common\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003epresenting data on a consistent basis no matter where it was sourced, making it easier for practitioners to quickly understand issues and make informed decisions\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eimproving transparency and public trust that personal data is used ethically\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eless effort and manual intervention needed to share useful information, making it quicker and more cost-effective to share using open data standards to reduce vendor lock-in, allowing government to procure technology based on value for money and relevant features\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ebetter search and extraction of information to meet Freedom of Information (FOI) requirements, which is critical to government’s efforts to build transparency and public trust\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo improve data interoperability, the DSA builds cross-government consensus on defining and agreeing standards. This improves collaboration, encouraging experts across sectors to consider problems and risks in detail. This helps the experts identify the right data standards and provide the right levers, as well as support, to encourage consistent and wide adoption across government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese levers include spend controls managed by the Cabinet Office, as well as service assessments and business reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DSA also considers how to implement new controls to make sure data standards are adopted and supported by an assurance process. The DSA looks for opportunities and incentives to increase adoption of standards across the wider public sector. This can lead to simpler integration of data from central government sources, or for departmental data to integrate more easily into central government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo assess and articulate the benefits of adopting data standards, the DSA forms processes to help identify and showcase implementation of standards, or pilots of new standards to demonstrate the value of adopting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DSA works closely with the devolved administrations and international governments to make sure there is alignment on standards, share best practice and tackle common problems together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of limited resources and the breadth of aspects of data that could benefit from being standardised, the scope of the DSA’s work needs to be focused on areas of greatest cross-government priority and user need. The DSA focuses on data standards that relate to and support data sharing and multi-agency cooperation, as well as linking data. This leads to producing new data insights across government, and new products and services to make use of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"objectives\"\u003eObjectives\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DSA has 2 main objectives:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eSetting cross-government data standards by identifying which areas benefit most from standardisation and developing standards for wider adoption.

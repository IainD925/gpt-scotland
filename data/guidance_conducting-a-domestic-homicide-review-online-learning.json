In 2009 to 2010, the British Crime Survey showed that domestic violence accounted for 14% of all violent incidents and affects both men and women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic violence is frequently repeated by the perpetrator and the violence can escalate over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA domestic attack that results in the death of the victim is often not a first attack and is likely to have been preceded by psychological and emotional abuse. Many people and agencies may have known of previous attacks – neighbours may have heard violence, a GP may have examined injuries, the police may have been called, there may have been previous prosecutions or injunctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis can sometimes make serious injury and homicide in domestic violence cases preventable with early intervention. Local agencies should have adequate policies and procedures in place to instruct staff on how to intervene in domestic violence cases. There should also be an emphasis on the need for specialist support for victims and their children as well as services for families, friends and others who may be affected by the homicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-domestic-homicide-reviews\"\u003eAbout domestic homicide reviews\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe basis for the domestic homicide review process is to ensure agencies are responding appropriately to victims of domestic violence by offering and putting in place suitable support mechanisms, procedures, resources and interventions with an aim to avoid future incidents of domestic homicide and violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review will also assess whether agencies have sufficient procedures and protocols in place, which were understood and followed by their staff and where there may be a need to improve these procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA domestic homicide review should be carried out to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eestablish what lessons are to be learned from the domestic homicide regarding the way in which local professionals and organisations work individually and together to safeguard victims.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eidentify clearly what those lessons are both within and between agencies, how and within what timescales they will be acted on, and what is expected to change as a result.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapply these lessons to service responses including changes to policies and procedures as appropriate.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprevent domestic violence homicide and improve service responses for all domestic violence victims and their children through improved intra and inter-agency working.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDomestic homicide reviews are not inquiries into how the victim died or into who is to blame - that is a matter for coroners and criminal courts to determine.\nDomestic homicide reviews are also not a part of any disciplinary enquiry or process. Where information emerges in the course of a review suggesting that disciplinary action should be taken, the agency concerned will follow its own internal disciplinary procedures separately to the domestic homicide review process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"setting-up-a-review-the-role-of-community-safety-partnerships-csps\"\u003eSetting up a review: the role of community safety partnerships (CSPs)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a domestic homicide happens, the police should inform the relevant community safety partnership (CSP) in writing of the incident.

Independent domestic violence advisers (IDVAs) and specialist domestic violence services are key representatives to include on the review panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany CSP areas will already have established local forums that deal with domestic violence and hold a wealth of knowledge in understanding its complexities.

No organisations will be given direct access to government-held data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot is a collaborative project run by GDS, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and HM Passport Office (HMPO).

The DCS will then tell your organisation if the passport is valid by sending it a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA passport that’s been cancelled or reported as lost or stolen will return a ‘no’ response, but the check will not show what caused this response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA ‘yes’ response confirms the passport is valid at the point in time it is checked. A passport may later be cancelled, lost or stolen. If you check the same passport details again in the future, it will count as a new check for billing and volume reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can pass on the trust from the check to a third party. The purpose of the third party’s check will also need to be to prevent crime. The check confirms passport validity at the point in time it is checked. Beyond this point, there’s a risk the check may no longer be valid because the status of the passport may have changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-much-it-costs\"\u003eHow much it costs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll need to pay a one-off connection fee for the pilot and 50p per check.

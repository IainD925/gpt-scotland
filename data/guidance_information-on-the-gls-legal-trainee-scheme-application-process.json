The questions are based on the types of scenario you may encounter as a legal trainee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, spending time reading about the work of our legal trainees or by watching our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trainees-view-of-our-legal-trainee-scheme\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eshort film\u003c/a\u003e may give you an insight into our ethos. The best approach is to draw upon your experience and instinct to indicate how you would (and wouldn’t) respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that the \u003cabbr title=\"situational judgement test\"\u003eSJT\u003c/abbr\u003e is untimed.

This is, of course, only a suggested approach. You should make use of all the time available and approach the test in the way which feels most comfortable for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe real key is to focus on the question and not try to guess which of the options we are looking for.

Most notably the move from Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) to Annual Benefit Risk Reports (BRR), alongside Signal notifications throughout the year, sending of all adverse events within 30 days, and the move from submitting the Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance System (DDPS) with each Marketing Authorisation to the Pharmacovigilance System Master File (PSMF).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"adverse-event-reporting\"\u003eAdverse event reporting\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 17 May 2024 Marketing Authorisation Holders (MAHs) are required to submit all UK serious and non-serious, human, transmission of infectious agents, suspected lack of expected efficacy and environmental adverse events within 30 days of becoming aware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVMD is seeking advice from Defra lawyers to review the legislation regarding reporting of adverse events originating from clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance studies related to VMPs, to change the requirement to ‘MAHs must report adverse events without delay and no later than within 30 days from the date of the closure of the final study report’.

From roads to rivers, and health to human rights, our work touches on most aspects of public life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe department has 14 client-facing advisory teams who provide legal advice on the development, design and implementation of government policies and decisions, draft secondary legislation and work with \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-parliamentary-counsel\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eParliamentary Counsel\u003c/a\u003e on primary legislation. Our cross-cutting expert service groups for Litigation, Employment and Commercial Law provide specialist legal services to a wide range of government departments and public bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Transport\"\u003eDfT\u003c/abbr\u003e Legal Advisers advise the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDepartment for Transport (\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Transport\"\u003eDfT\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/a\u003e across a wide range of its functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Government’s rail programme has never been more ambitious. The Rail Group’s remit encompasses huge projects, including delivery of the next generation of intercity trains through the InterCity Express Programme, the Thameslink Upgrade and Crossrail - the biggest construction project in Europe. The Rail Group is also supporting the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/williams-rail-review\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWilliams Rail Review\u003c/a\u003e, a fundamental look at many aspects of the rail industry, as well as extensive ongoing rail franchising programme activity. Rail Group and High Speed Rail Group are also working with HS2 Ltd and Network Rail to plan and deliver the railway of the future, as well as managing today’s network through a period of major change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Groups are doing all of this against a backdrop of a highly complex and interconnected rail industry. Network Rail, train operating companies, rolling stock companies, manufacturers, the regulator and the wider supply chain all have roles to play. There are different levels of devolution to Scotland, Wales, London and some Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs). Our lawyers play a central role in supporting both Groups in delivering their challenging and diverse portfolio of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is significant political and media interest in rail, which makes the work of both Groups exceptionally high profile. Members of the Rail Commercial Contracts and Procurement Team, have also recently won a prestigious Legal 500 award. They were named as In-House Infrastructure Team of the Year for their work on the West Coast Partnership rail franchise competition.  The successful bidder will be the first operator of the High Speed 2 railway line so the team’s work is critical to delivering the benefits of this huge construction project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking to recruit lawyers with a commercial background to support this nationally important programme of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact\"\u003eContact\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor further information about the post and application enquiries, please contact the \u003ca href=\"mailto:govqualified@tmpw.co.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRecruitment Team\u003c/a\u003e or telephone 0845 3000 793 or 0117 923 4417.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c52fe83e5274a493c308ff8/Vacancy_Notice_GLD_Commercial_Rail_Lawyers_London.pdf\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--custom\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c52fe8340f0b6253c03c872/thumbnail_Vacancy_Notice_GLD_Commercial_Rail_Lawyers_London.pdf.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c52fe83e5274a493c308ff8/Vacancy_Notice_GLD_Commercial_Rail_Lawyers_London.pdf\"\u003eVacancy Notice GLD Commercial Rail Lawyers London\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e450 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e10 pages\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003eThis file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdetails class=\"gem-c-details govuk-details govuk-!-margin-bottom-3\" data-module=\"govuk-details gem-details ga4-event-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003csummary class=\"govuk-details__summary\" data-details-track-click=\"\" data-ga4-event=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"select_content\",\"type\":\"detail\",\"text\":\"Request an accessible format.\",\"section\":\"Request an accessible format.\",\"index_section\":1}\u0027\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"govuk-details__summary-text\" data-ga4-expandable\u003e\n      Request an accessible format.\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/summary\u003e  \u003cdiv class=\"govuk-details__text\"\u003e\n    \n        If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a version of this document in a more accessible format, please email \u003ca href=\"mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egovtrainees@tmpw.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e.

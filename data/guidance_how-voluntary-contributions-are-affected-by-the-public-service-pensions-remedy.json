This is because under the public service pensions remedy rollback of pensionable service from Chapter 1 new scheme to Chapter 1 legacy scheme does not affect voluntary contribution arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are times where you will be able to change how voluntary contributions are treated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, changes to pension scheme regulations made under the remedy will mean that scheme rights for voluntary contributions under the Chapter 1 new schemes will be extinguished and either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe scheme manager will pay compensation equivalent to the voluntary contributions paid to the Chapter 1 new scheme, minus an amount equivalent to any tax relief given on those contributions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epension rights will be given under the Chapter 1 legacy scheme:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eof the same value to the rights held under the Chapter 1 new scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ethat would have been held if the voluntary contributions had been paid to that scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome scheme regulations may change how the remedy applies, so that the rollback applies to voluntary contributions and would also be included within a new scheme benefits election. Where scheme regulations make these changes, voluntary contributions are treated in the same way as pension rights from pensionable service. Therefore, this could affect the members pension input amounts and the annual allowance or lifetime allowance position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eScheme regulations may give one or more options. The member may be given a choice, or the scheme regulations may impose an option. It is up to schemes to decide what options to offer their members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a member makes an election for new scheme benefits, this will not automatically convert benefits from voluntary contributions into new scheme benefits. The scheme regulations will need to allow for pension rights from voluntary contributions made during the remedy period (to either Chapter 1 legacy or new schemes) to be varied, to become new scheme benefits rights. The date the voluntary contribution rights start may not automatically follow on from the date the new scheme benefits election takes effect, this date will depend on the scheme regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"rollback\"\u003eRollback\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eScheme administrators of Chapter 1 new schemes will need to recalculate the pension input amounts under their scheme during the remedy period based on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erights relating to voluntary contributions paid into the scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erights given as a result of a transfer into the scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"extinguishing-voluntary-contribution-rights-under-a-chapter-1-new-scheme\"\u003eExtinguishing voluntary contribution rights under a Chapter 1 new scheme\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExtinguishing voluntary contributions as a result of the remedy does not change the pension input amounts for pension input periods (\u003cabbr title=\"pension input periods\"\u003ePIPs\u003c/abbr\u003e) for previous years.

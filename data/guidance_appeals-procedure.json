We assess student finance applications in line with the student support regulations that define who can get student finance and how much they can get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes, you may think we’ve not applied these regulations correctly when we’ve assessed your student finance application. If this is the case, you can appeal the decisions we’ve made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSLC can also accept appeals from third parties if you’ve given them permission to make an appeal on your behalf. The third party should be aware that we’ll not provide them with information we hold about you unless we know that you’ve given your consent. This can be done via SLC’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/allowing-someone-else-to-manage-your-student-loan-account\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econsent to share\u003c/a\u003e process. The third party will need to provide the security information used to set up consent to share each time they contact us on your behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re unhappy with a decision we’ve made about your student finance and don’t think we’ve kept to the regulations, you should make an appeal as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if we initially gave you student finance that you weren’t entitled to because we didn’t take your previous study into account.

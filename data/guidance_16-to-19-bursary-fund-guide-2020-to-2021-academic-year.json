This includes schools, academies, further education (FE) colleges, sixth-form colleges, training providers, specialist independent providers and local authorities. Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) refers to all of these as ‘institutions’ throughout this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide sets out the funding rules for the bursary fund and forms part of institutions’ ESFA funding agreements. Institutions must comply with the rules when setting their discretionary bursary policies, assessing individual student eligibility and need, and making payments. They must be able to show they comply with these funding rules at any audit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide covers the period of 1 August 2020 to 31 July 2021 and is our current advice for the funding year. We know that providers are working through exceptional circumstances due to coronavirus (COVID-19). We may publish further updates to this guide about the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on our guidance as these become clear. We will tell you about any changes in our ESFA update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued hard work in these difficult times.\nFor further information, please read \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-schools-and-other-educational-settings\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethis guidance to help schools and other educational settings provide advice for staff, parents and carers, pupils and students about coronavirus (COVID-19)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"to-19-bursary-fund-a-summary\"\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund: a summary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 16 to 19 Bursary Fund provides financial support to help students overcome the specific financial barriers to participation they face so they can remain in education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursaries:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebursaries for defined vulnerable groups of up to £1,200 a year\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ediscretionary bursaries which institutions award using policies they set, in line with these funding rules\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"key-points-for-the-2020-to-2021-academic-year\"\u003eKey points for the 2020 to 2021 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department for Education (DfE) has revised the methodology used to calculate discretionary bursary allocations to better match financial disadvantage and student needs across the country. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/16-to-19-discretionary-bursary-fund-allocation-methodology\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGovernment response to the consultation\u003c/a\u003e about the change can be read on GOV.UK. The revised methodology is being used from the 2020 to 2021 academic year onwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"#Funding\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efunding and allocations: discretionary bursaries\u003c/a\u003e section of these funding rules contains a summary of the methodology, but institutions should refer to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2020-to-2021\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eexplanatory notes\u003c/a\u003e that accompany funding allocations (issued in February/March 2020) for full detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they assess the needs of individual students when awarding bursary funding. ESFA audit and assurance work and ongoing monitoring/feedback activity by DfE continues to find a considerable number of institutions are making flat rate payments to students without any consideration of individual student needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth types of bursary funding are designed to help students overcome the individual financial barriers to participation that they face and institutions must ensure the funds go to those who genuinely need them. No student should automatically be awarded a set amount of funding without an assessment of the level of need they have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they have a clear and accessible policy or statement setting out how they will use their bursary fund, the eligibility criteria they use and any terms and conditions they set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide now includes a \u003ca href=\"#checklist\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003echecklist\u003c/a\u003e institutions can use when assessing bursary applications from students and a \u003ca href=\"#summary\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esummary\u003c/a\u003e that lists the most important things that institutions should and shouldn’t do when administering the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.

However, in exceptional circumstances institutions may use their discretion to pay bursaries to younger students, for example, where a student is following an accelerated study programme. Exceptional circumstances do not include students aged 14 to 16 who are attending college as part of their key stage 4 programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged under 19 enrolled on higher education qualifications are not eligible for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"eligible-education-provision\"\u003eEligible education provision\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must be participating in provision that is subject to inspection by a public body that assures quality (for example Ofsted). The provision must also be either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efunded directly by ESFA or by ESFA via a local authority\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efunded or co-financed by the European Social Fund\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eotherwise publicly funded and lead to a qualification (up to and including level 3) accredited by Ofqual or on the ESFA list of qualifications approved for funding 14 to 19\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea 16 to 19 traineeship programme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents on apprenticeship programmes, or any waged training, are employed, rather than in education. They are not eligible for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNon-employed students aged 16 to 19 who are participating in a Prince’s Trust Team Programme are eligible to receive the bursary in the same way as any other student participating in an eligible, publicly funded course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA does not expect students on distance learning provision to need help from the bursary fund because they do not have the kinds of costs the bursary is intended to cover (travel, equipment and uniforms, for example). In the rare instances where an institution identifies such a student does require financial help, they should provide support in-kind. An example could be providing a temporary travel pass for the student to attend exams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"residency\"\u003eResidency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must meet the residency criteria in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eESFA funding regulations\u003c/a\u003e for post-16 provision. This document also specifies the evidence institutions must see and retain for audit to confirm eligibility for post-16 funding (and therefore meet the residency criteria for bursary fund eligibility).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"accompanied-asylum-seeking-children-under-18-with-an-adult-relative-or-partner\"\u003eAccompanied asylum seeking children (under 18 with an adult relative or partner)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, asylum seekers are not entitled to public funds. Accompanied asylum seeking children (those under 18 with an adult relative or partner) and those aged 18 and above are entitled to education, but not to public funds. If they are destitute they can apply to the Home Office for suitable housing and cash for essentials, but they are not eligible for other income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as an asylum seeker has not had their application for asylum refused, institutions can provide in-kind student support such as books, equipment or a travel pass. Under no circumstances should an institution give cash to any asylum seeker unless they are an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child (UASC).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unaccompanied-asylum-seeking-children\"\u003eUnaccompanied asylum seeking children\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnaccompanied asylum seeking children do not receive cash support from the Home Office and are the responsibility of the local authority. They are treated as looked after children and are eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups (‘in care’ group), where they have a financial need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen these young people reach legal adulthood at age 18, institutions must consider their immigration status. If the asylum claim is decided in their favour, the local authority must provide them with the same support and services as they do care leavers. As such, they continue to be eligible for a bursary as a student from a vulnerable group until they reach the upper age limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an asylum claim is not supported, the individual may not be able to stay legally in the UK. When asylum claims have been fully heard/the appeals process exhausted, an individual has no entitlement to public funds (with a few exceptions where the withdrawal of support would be seen as a breach of human rights).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility-criteria-bursaries-for-young-people-in-defined-vulnerable-groups\"\u003eEligibility criteria: bursaries for young people in defined vulnerable groups\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents who meet the criteria, and who have a financial need, can apply for a bursary for vulnerable groups. The defined groups reflect that these students are unlikely to be receiving financial assistance from parents or carers, so may need a greater level of support to enable them to continue to participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents should be awarded the amount of support they need to participate based on an assessment of the types of costs they have. Institutions must ensure students are eligible for the bursary for defined vulnerable groups in each year they require support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe defined vulnerable groups are students who are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein care\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecare leavers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereceiving Income Support, or Universal Credit because they are financially supporting themselves or financially supporting themselves and someone who is dependent on them and living with them such as a child or partner\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereceiving Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments in their own right as well as Employment and Support Allowance or Universal Credit in their own right\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are continuing to review the descriptions of the defined vulnerable groups to reflect the ongoing rollout of Universal Credit and ensure they accurately reflect the purpose of the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bursary for vulnerable groups can pay up to £1,200 per year to a student participating on study programme that lasts for 30 weeks or more if they need that amount of support. Students on study programmes of less than 30 weeks should be paid a pro-rata amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should also consider the number of hours involved in student’s study programme when deciding if a pro-rata payment is more appropriate. A student studying for around 16 hours a week is likely to have greater costs than a student studying for 4 hours a week, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may decide that although a young person may be eligible for a bursary because they are in one or more of the defined vulnerable groups, they do not have any actual financial need. This might be because their financial needs are already met and/or because they have no relevant costs. Institutions can refuse a student’s application on this basis. Similarly, students should only receive the amount they actually need to participate and institutions should not automatically award students £1,200 if they do not need the full amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEqually, institutions can pay a bursary to a vulnerable group student of more than £1,200 if they assess they need extra help to remain in education. Any payments over £1,200 must be paid from their discretionary bursary allocation or from their own funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"defining-in-care-and-care-leavers\"\u003eDefining in care and care leavers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 16 to 19 Bursary Fund defines ‘in care’ as ‘Children looked after by a local authority on a voluntary basis (section 20 of the Children Act 1989) or under a care order (section 31 of the Children Act 1989) - Section 22 of the Children Act 1989 defines the term ‘looked after child’.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA ‘care leaver’ is defined as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea young person aged 16 and 17 who was previously looked after for a period of 13 weeks consecutively (or periods amounting to 13 weeks), which began after the age of 14 and ended after the age of 16; or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea young person aged 18 or above who was looked after prior to becoming 18 for a period of 13 weeks consecutively (or periods amounting to 13 weeks), which began after the age of 14 and ended after the age of 16\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"foster-care-including-privately-arranged-foster-care\"\u003eFoster care, including privately arranged foster care\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA young person placed with a foster carer by the local authority, including where the foster carer is on the books of an independent fostering agency, is classed as looked after. They meet the criteria for the ‘in care’ vulnerable group where they need financial support to participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA child who is privately fostered (in other words, a private arrangement is made between the parent and the person who will care for the child) is not classed as a looked after child and is not eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some instances, a young person may have been in the care of the local authority and the care transferred to another party via a permanent form of fostering such as a Special Guardianship Order. In these circumstances, the young person is defined as having left care so is now a care leaver. They must meet the definition of a ‘care leaver’ in full (so, the period of weeks and age range set out above). If they do, they are eligible for help from the bursary for vulnerable groups, where they need financial support to participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"universal-credit\"\u003eUniversal Credit\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUniversal Credit (UC) is being rolled out across the country and will gradually replace Income Support and Employment and Support Allowance as well as other benefits. Institutions will increasingly see students claiming bursaries for defined vulnerable groups based on receiving UC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUC award notifications do not include any information on the benefits they replace. For this reason, the description of the bursaries for vulnerable group category that relates to receipt of UC or Income Support is that a student must be receiving UC in their own right because they are financially supporting themselves and anyone who is dependent on them and living with them such as a child or partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are continuing to review the descriptions of the defined vulnerable groups to reflect the ongoing rollout of Universal Credit and ensure they accurately reflect the purpose of the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBursary funds awarded to a student should not form part of the UC assessment undertaken by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). How DWP treat any funding for education depends on whether the student is undertaking advanced full time education. It is unlikely that 16 to 18 year olds will be in advanced full time education as they are generally on study programmes at level 3 or below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe do encourage institutions to provide support from the bursary fund by making payments in kind where possible. Institutions must not make bursary fund payments as regular payments for living costs. This is out of scope of the bursary fund and any such payments would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income-related Benefits) Regulations 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"evidence-of-eligibility\"\u003eEvidence of eligibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must obtain proof that students meet the criteria for the bursary for vulnerable groups in full. In other words, that they are in receipt of the specified benefits in their own name or that they fully meet the definitions for in care/care leavers.

Students who meet the criteria and who are on study programmes lasting for less than 30 weeks should be given a bursary on a pro-rata basis (with the actual amount dependent on the specific financial needs they have).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea student is on a 30 week programme.

This ensures all parties understand that meeting the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups does not automatically mean funding will be given. Institutions should ensure their forms avoid any terminology such as ‘guaranteed bursary’ or wording such as ‘you will automatically get a bursary of £1,200 if you are in one of the defined groups’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility-criteria-discretionary-bursaries\"\u003eEligibility criteria: discretionary bursaries\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions make discretionary bursary awards to help students with the cost of travel, to buy essential books, equipment or specialist clothing (such as protective overalls, for example).

This means institutions should use household income in some way to help establish the amount of support they award to a student. This can be used in conjunction with other factors, such as distance to travel from the institution and the number of dependent children in the household, as well as the actual participation needs the student has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is for institutions to decide the process they use to assess household income, and the specific evidence they request from students/their families. However, DfE is aware that some institutions are unsure about how to use UC award notices when these are provided as evidence of household income. DfE suggests institutions may wish to ask for the 3 most recent monthly award statements. The take-home pay figure in addition to the amount of UC after all deductions will give a total monthly income. Using 3 months statements will act as a guide to the household income for a quarter of a year. Institutions could then estimate assumed income for a full year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of a UC award notice is below.

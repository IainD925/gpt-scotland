However, to help contain the virus, office workers who can work effectively from home should do so over the winter.  Where an employer, in consultation with their employee, judges an employee can carry out their normal duties from home they should do so. Public sector employees working in essential services, including education settings, should continue to go into work where necessary. Anyone else who cannot work from home should go to their place of work. The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local authority in Bolton and national regulators (including HSE) will be undertaking stronger enforcement to ensure workplaces are COVID-19 Secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"financial-support--furlough-and-self-isolation\"\u003eFinancial support – furlough and self-isolation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wages-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and New Style Employment and Support Allowance.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"childcare\"\u003eChildcare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can continue to use \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eearly years and childcare settings\u003c/a\u003e, including childminders and providers offering \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ebefore or after school clubs or other out-of-school settings\u003c/a\u003e for children.

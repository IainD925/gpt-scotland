Once you have consulted a lawyer, the first step is to write to the developer to explain that due to non-compliance with the contract, you want to rescind the contract and request that the deposits paid so far are returned, as well as the accrued interest. You should include any relevant documentation (e.g. a copy of the contract, copies of payments made, copy of the bank guarantee) and state a timeframe by which you want the amount to be reimbursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you believe you have been a victim of fraud and you have neither a bank guarantee nor an insurance policy from the developer, you should seek independent legal advice regarding taking criminal legal action through the courts and register a statement with the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"condominium-management-contracts\"\u003eCondominium Management Contracts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf buying an apartment in a block of flats or a closed residential complex, investors are usually required to sign a secondary contract relating to the management of the condominium, e.g. paying costs associated with the communal management of the apartment block and maintaining the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes developers require signature of the management contract at the time of buying the property and will not sell it otherwise. You should pay extra care and ask your legal adviser to check the property management contract carefully as sometimes there may be exorbitant costs attached to it.  You should also make sure that your contract has the same terms and conditions as for all other owners. It is not an uncommon practice for foreign owners to be offered a different management contract compared to Bulgarian nationals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Bulgarian Condominium Act all expenses for the management and maintenance of the common parts under the condominium ownership arrangement should be equally shared by owners, users and residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRepair, renovation and reconstruction of common parts or replacement of common facilities and equipment should be carried out after an agreement is reached at the General Meeting of owners.

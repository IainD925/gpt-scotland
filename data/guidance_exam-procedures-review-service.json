We will consider whether the awarding organisation followed its own procedures correctly and whether it complied with our rules. We won’t review your work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe cannot tell the awarding organisation to change your grade. Your grade will only change if the awarding organisation decides your grade was wrong and needs to be corrected. It is important to remember that a new grade could be higher or lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is for qualifications awarded after 1 December 2021. If you got your results in August 2021 it is probably too late for us to look at your case. You should contact our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ask-ofqual-common-questions-answered\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePublic Enquiries team\u003c/a\u003e if you think there is an exceptional reason why we could look at your August 2021 grade now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-exam-procedures-review-service\"\u003eWhat is the Exam Procedures Review Service?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Exam Procedures Review Service (EPRS) is one of the ways Ofqual can look at the procedures an awarding organisation followed when it marked an assessment, moderated a teacher’s marking of non-exam assessment (NEA), completed any review of marking or moderation and when it determined an appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will look at any application which meets our criteria and decide whether the awarding organisation followed its procedures properly and whether it complied with our rules. We won’t look at your case unless you have completed every stage of the awarding organisation’s appeals process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-can-apply\"\u003eWho can apply?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust like an application for a review of marking or moderation, or an appeal, most students can’t apply directly for an EPRS review. Instead, you should talk to your school or college and ask them to consider making an application for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate candidates – who registered for their qualification individually and applied for a review of marking and an appeal without help from a school or college – can make their own applications to EPRS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur EPRS process is only available for the following qualifications, where they are regulated by us:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGCSE, AS, and A Levels\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTechnical Qualifications (part of a T Level)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLevel 3 Project qualifications (EPQ)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will only accept applications from schools, colleges, and other exam centres in the UK or from private candidates who completed their assessments in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will only accept an application after the awarding organisation has made a decision at the final stage of its appeal process (often called a Stage 2 appeal decision).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will not review your work and cannot change your grade, but we can ask the awarding organisation to look at your appeal again if we think it made a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-apply--centre-candidates\"\u003eHow to apply – centre candidates\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you think the awarding organisation made a mistake which was not resolved through its reviews and appeals process you should talk to your school or college about making an application to the EPRS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should have this conversation promptly, because we might not accept an application which is made more than 3 weeks after the final appeal decision, unless there is a very good reason for the delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your school or college agrees to make an application for you, it will need to \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://contact.ofqual.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econtact our public enquiries team\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should set out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe qualification (for example, GCSE or A Level) you want us to look at\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe name and address of your school, college, or other exam centre\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe date of the letter from the awarding organisation with your final appeal decision and the name of the awarding organisation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-apply--private-candidates\"\u003eHow to apply – private candidates\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a private candidate, you can make an application to the EPRS yourself when you have a final appeal decision.

Your centre, or you if you are a private candidate, must provide as much information as possible to answer the questions on the form. The form will set out the documents we need to receive with the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-will-we-do\"\u003eWhat will we do?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we receive a completed form, we will decide what further information we need.

We will give you a chance to reply to our letter, and to tell us if you think we have missed something out or misunderstood something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will tell you how long you have to reply. If you don’t reply, we will close your case using the information we have. If you reply, we will decide whether anything you tell us changes our view about whether anything went wrong. We will either write to you explaining why our view has not changed or we will decide something might have gone wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"if-we-think-something-went-wrong\"\u003eIf we think something went wrong\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we think the awarding organisation might have got something wrong, we will write to them and ask whether they agree with us. If they agree, we would usually expect them to look at your case again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf they don’t agree, we will consider whether any extra information they have given us changes our view about whether or not something went wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we still think something went wrong, we will invite your centre (or you if you are a private candidate) and the awarding organisation to a meeting with us, to talk about your case. We will make a final decision after the meeting. We will explain how the meeting will work when we set it up. The meeting will usually be held remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf our final decision is that the awarding organisation has got something wrong, we will explain what we think went wrong, and why, in a letter. We will send that letter to your centre (or you if you are a private candidate) and to the awarding organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur rules say the awarding organisation must ‘give due regard’ to what we say in our letter. This means the awarding organisation must read what we say, and think about any recommendations we make, and it must decide what to do next. This might mean looking at your appeal again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe cannot tell the awarding organisation to change your grade. Your grade will only change if the awarding organisation decides your grade was wrong and needs to be corrected.

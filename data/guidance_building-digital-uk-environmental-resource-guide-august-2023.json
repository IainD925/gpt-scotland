Purpose\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo provide broadband suppliers and mobile operators (and any subcontractors or agents) with a single reference point for environmental requirements and resources, in relation to delivering digital infrastructure in England. It should ensure a reasonable standard of environmental awareness is applied during survey, design, build and operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis should also help the sector with climate adaptation solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhilst this guide is for Building Digital UK (BDUK) funded infrastructure, it can be applied across other digital infrastructure delivery across all government departments, such as the Rural England Shared Prosperity Fund, as well as commercial rollout funded privately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will also be able to support the rollout of hybrid and standalone satellite solutions, as many of the terminals are likely to be placed in very remote areas. This means they are likely to have higher exposure to extreme weather events and potentially limited access to the mains power grid. At present satellite terminals also have higher power consumption requirements than traditional fixed or mobile connectivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis resource guide can also be utilised as an initial starting point for broadband providers and mobile operators in UK nations with devolved administrations, because of likely parallels in environmental impacts to consider. BDUK is collaborating with each devolved administration and anticipates standalone telecoms environmental guidance in accordance with their legislation, policy and strategic priorities, in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea breakdown of scope 1 to 3 Greenhouse Gas emissions (see \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egreenhouse gas protocol\u003c/a\u003e page 26)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003escientific targets on air quality, water quality and/or conservation, biodiversity, and resource efficiency/waste reduction\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edevolved environmental matters to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eall relevant legislation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean exhaustive list of links and resources\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhile this document is intended to assist with and illustrate many of the key requirements that will need to be complied with, it is not a comprehensive statement of all relevant environmental regulation.

There is no one size fits all approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, there is no one standardised approach or single sector lead for non-mandatory environmental improvements on digital infrastructure networks, and not all in the sector have access to the same resources or finances to focus on the environment to the same degree. This guide (for some) could be the impetus for change and improvements and help the sector with climate adaptation solutions. Noting, some larger suppliers and operators are already demonstrating leadership in environmental solutions, and this resource guide would be complementary to those efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"review-period\"\u003e2. Review period\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is only the start to a rapidly changing area, and it is anticipated there will be more changes on environmental improvements over the next few years.

Background\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK was part of the Paris Agreement 2015 to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Following this, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e25 year environment plan: A Green Future 2018\u003c/a\u003e outlined how the government will improve the environment within a generation. The UK was the first parliament in the world (in 2019) to embed 100% net zero carbon emissions by 2050 into legislation. In 2021, the government set an ambitious target to reach a third of this by reducing emissions to 78% by 2035, compared to 1990 levels (see \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/27/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eClimate Change Act 2008\u003c/a\u003e). \nPost Brexit, the government has redefined environmental protection for air quality, water,  and resource efficiency/waste reduction in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/30/contents/enacted\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEnvironment Act 2021\u003c/a\u003e. The Environment Act 2021 also includes new provisions to include biodiversity net gain as a mandatory part of the planning permission process. The establishment of an \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.theoep.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOffice for Environmental Protection\u003c/a\u003e gives this independent public body the discretion to scrutinise the government’s environmental performance and to take enforcement action against ministers, government departments and other public authorities for failures to comply with environmental law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-improvement-plan\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEnvironmental Improvement Plan 2023\u003c/a\u003e (the first revision of the government’s 25 year environmental plan) sets out how the government will work with landowners, communities and businesses to improve the environment.

BDUK’s role\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are supporting the government’s target of at least 85% connectivity by 2025 through a combination of suppliers’ commercial build and subsidised build, and then to nationwide gigabit-capable broadband by 2030. We are also supporting the partnership with mobile network operators to reach the government’s target of 95% 4G mobile coverage from at least one mobile network operator by the end of 2025, with further coverage improvements in the more hard-to-reach areas to continue to be delivered until the start of 2027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBDUK is an executive agency within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), that funds digital infrastructure networks by suppliers and operators, outside of commercial rollout plans. This includes the £5 billion Project Gigabit programme and the £1 billion Shared Rural Network 4G mobile partnership programme. None of this funding is allocated to data centres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of its programmes to deliver digital infrastructure, BDUK has an objective to evaluate the benefits and dis-benefits of its interventions. This is the first year BDUK is providing environmental guidance for deployment, and undertaking environmental evaluation.  BDUK acknowledges greater clarity is required to inform and support the sector - especially since digital infrastructure networks have a crucial role to play in net zero realisation. Without gigabit-capable infrastructure some sectors may not be able to transform and adapt at the pace anticipated to support challenges of climate change, innovation around carbon reductions and biodiversity improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters of the Crown (including the minister responsible for BDUK) “must, when making policy, have due regard to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-principles-policy-statement\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epolicy statement\u003c/a\u003e on environmental principles” effective from 1 November 2023, by virtue of the Environment Act 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo date, BDUK has incorporated key procurement policy notes into its bid evaluation process for contracts on social value (and environment) \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0620-taking-account-of-social-value-in-the-award-of-central-government-contracts\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePPN06/20\u003c/a\u003e and net zero carbon reduction plans for contracts valued over £5 million per annum in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0621-taking-account-of-carbon-reduction-plans-in-the-procurement-of-major-government-contracts\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePPN06/21\u003c/a\u003e.

These are typically clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure and cardiovascular events. \u003cabbr title=\"Cost effectiveness analysis\"\u003eCEA\u003c/abbr\u003e enables you to compare the costs and health effects of your digital product with alternatives, as long as the effects of the different interventions are measured in the same units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe incremental cost and incremental effect of your product can then be combined into a single metric, for example, cost per cardiovascular event averted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Cost effectiveness analysis\"\u003eCEA\u003c/abbr\u003e results can help decision-makers who want to achieve a specific health objective. For example, a \u003cabbr title=\"Cost effectiveness analysis\"\u003eCEA\u003c/abbr\u003e study can help a health commissioner decide which mobile app to invest in to manage the most patients with type-2 diabetes by identifying the app that provides the lowest cost per managed diabetes case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse a cost effectiveness analysis when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou want to assess the value for money of your digital product compared to alternative options using the same unit of effect, usually to do with a particular disease\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe benefits of using your product are mostly health-related\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eclinical measures are most appropriate to capture the health benefits from using your product\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pros\"\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages of \u003cabbr title=\"Cost effectiveness analysis\"\u003eCEA\u003c/abbr\u003e include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eclinical outcomes are relatively straightforward to measure, particularly if the  economic evaluation is linked to a clinical trial\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit gives you an assessment of alternative options based on disease-specific measures of health effects\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cons\"\u003eCons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDrawbacks of \u003cabbr title=\"Cost effectiveness analysis\"\u003eCEA\u003c/abbr\u003e include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit cannot inform broader resource allocation decisions across different diseases because health benefits will often be measured in different units (different clinical outcomes)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-a-cost-effectiveness-analysis\"\u003eHow to carry out a cost effectiveness analysis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should follow the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/economic-evaluation-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egeneral considerations for any economic evaluation study\u003c/a\u003e.

Because it is restricted to clinical outcomes, you may miss broader health-related benefits.

This can be done by reporting incremental cost, incremental effect and cost per unit of effect gained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your product generates more effects and costs less than the alternatives, then it is unambiguously cost-effective and should be adopted. If your product generates less effect and costs more than the alternatives, then it is clearly not good value for money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome digital products are, however, both more effective and more costly than the alternatives. To work out whether the additional benefits are worth the extra cost, you need to look at the cost per unit of effect. Your product will be judged cost-effective if it provides the lowest cost per unit of effect, as in the HeLP-Diabetes example below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-help-diabetes\"\u003eExample: HeLP-Diabetes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLi and others (2018), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29884608/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCost-effectiveness of facilitated access to a self-management website, compared to usual care, for patients with type-2 diabetes (HeLP-Diabetes): randomized controlled trial\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe study used a \u003cabbr title=\"Cost effectiveness analysis\"\u003eCEA\u003c/abbr\u003e to assess the costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of the HeLP-Diabetes programme compared to usual care for type 2 diabetic patients. The study took the perspective of the UK NHS and personal social services, so it excluded costs beyond those to the healthcare system and non-health effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe overall aim of HELP-Diabetes was to improve the management of diabetes, so the main health outcome considered was diabetes-related distress, measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire.

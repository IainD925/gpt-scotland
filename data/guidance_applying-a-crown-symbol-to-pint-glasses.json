In 2006 the crown stamp was replaced by the CE mark, which was a new conformity marking required by EU legislation, and the crown stamp was no longer required as a conformity marking for pint glasses in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2)\tThe crown symbol is fondly remembered by many people as a symbol that they associate with traditional pint measures. In recognition of the heritage of the crown stamp, the Government is providing this guidance on how manufacturers can apply a crown symbol to beer glasses as a decorative mark on a voluntary basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3)\tPint glasses used to measure and sell drinks will still be required to continue to display the legally required conformity markings to show they are accurate, in addition to any voluntary decorative markings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"history-of-the-crown-stamp-on-pint-glasses\"\u003eHistory of the crown stamp on pint glasses\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4)\tAs long ago as 1698 British pint glasses intended for measuring and serving beer were marked with a crown stamp as a declaration that the glass, when filled to the brim or to a line measure, accurately measured a pint of beer. The crown stamp therefore gave customers confidence that they were not being sold a short measure of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5)\tBefore 2006 the crown stamp was used by Local Authority Trading Standards Officers and Government-approved verifiers to indicate conformity with legal requirements. It took the form of an image of the St Edward’s Crown with the identification number of the trading standards inspector or government-approved verifier underneath:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62961a03e90e070397a00fb0/crown-stamp-guidance-image-1.jpg\" alt=\"Example of the Crown Stamp on a pint glass in use pre-2006.\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFigure 1:\u003c/strong\u003e An example of the Crown Stamp on a pint glass in use pre-2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6)\tThe 2004 EU Measuring Instruments Directive, which came into force in 2006, required the use of the EU-wide ‘CE-mark’ as a conformity assessment marking for pint glasses, alongside the “M” metrology marking. To implement the Directive, legislation was introduced in the UK to replace the crown stamp with the new conformity markings set out by the EU legislation. The new conformity markings were applied by the manufacturer as a declaration that the glass met the legal requirements that applied to it, including for measurement accuracy. As a result, the use of the crown stamp as an indication of measurement accuracy for pint glasses ceased in 2006.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-required-conformity-markings-for-pint-glasses\"\u003eThe required conformity markings for pint glasses\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7)\tToday, when glasses are used to measure and sell liquid – such as pint glasses or half pint glasses in a pub – they are classified as ‘capacity serving measures’ and are regulated by the Measuring Instruments Regulations 2016. They are required to measure liquid accurately and must carry the relevant conformity markings to signify that they meet the legal requirements:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn Great Britain, since 1 January 2021, capacity serving measures are required by the Measuring Instrument Regulations 2016 (as amended) to carry the UKCA marking to indicate conformity with the legal requirements, along with the M marking.

Only the legally required conformity assessment markings – the UKCA mark in GB (or the CE mark in GB until 1 January 2025) and the CE mark or CE + UKNI mark in Northern Ireland – indicate that a pint glass or other capacity serving measure may be used as a measuring instrument for trade and give confidence that the measure has been assessed and declared by the manufacturer to be in conformity with the regulations.

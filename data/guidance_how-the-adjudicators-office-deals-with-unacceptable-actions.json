Our customers have a right to be heard, understood and respected. We work hard to be open and easily accessible to all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, an individual’s behaviour or actions can make it difficult for us to deal with their complaint. On a small number of occasions, an individual’s behaviour or actions become unacceptable because they involve abuse of our staff or our process. When this happens, we have to take appropriate action to protect our staff. We also consider the impact of the behaviour on our ability to do our work and provide a service to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis policy explains how we will approach these situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-actions-do-we-consider-to-be-unacceptable\"\u003eWhat actions do we consider to be unacceptable?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, individuals may act out of character in times of trouble or distress. There may have been upsetting or distressing circumstances leading up to a complaint to our office. Although we acknowledge that customers may feel strongly about their complaint, we do not consider unreasonable demands to our office, or unreasonable behaviour towards our staff to be acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe aim to manage the following actions under this policy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"aggressive-or-abusive-behaviour\"\u003eAggressive or abusive behaviour\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not expect our staff to tolerate any form of behaviour that could be considered abusive, offensive or threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eViolence is not restricted to acts of aggression that may result in physical harm. It also includes behaviour or language (verbal or written) that may cause staff to feel afraid, threatened or abused, and may include threats, personal verbal abuse, derogatory remarks and rudeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also consider inflammatory statements and unsubstantiated allegations to be abusive behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unreasonable-demands\"\u003eUnreasonable demands\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny behaviour or actions which impact substantially on the work of the office, is unacceptable. We will judge each situation individually, and appreciate that some individuals that come to us may be upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome examples of what we consider to be ‘unreasonable demands’, include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRepeatedly demanding responses within an unreasonable timescale\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConstantly changing the basis of the complaint, and introducing unimportant or irrelevant new information as the investigation proceeds\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRefusing to accept our decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRepeatedly arguing points with no new supporting evidence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eInsisting on seeing or speaking to a particular member of staff or the Adjudicator, when it is not necessary or possible to do so\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of these demands takes up an excessive amount of staff time or resources resulting in other customers being disadvantaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unreasonable-level-of-contact\"\u003eUnreasonable level of contact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, the volume and duration of contact made by an individual to our office causes problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLevels of contact become unacceptable when the amount of time spent talking to a customer on the telephone, or responding to, reviewing and filing written correspondence impacts on our ability to deal with that complaint, or with other people’s complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis can occur over a short period of time, for example, a number of emails or telephone calls to our office in one day or one hour. This can also occur over a life-span of a complaint when a customer repeatedly makes long telephone calls to us, or inundates us with emails or copies of information that has already been sent, or that is irrelevant to the complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-actions-may-we-take\"\u003eWhat actions may we take?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEnd all direct contact with the customer if staff feel threatened. This may be the threat or use of physical violence, verbal abuse, or harassment. Incidents will be reported to the police if physical violence is used or threatened\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNot accept any correspondence that is abusive to staff or contains allegations which lack sufficient evidence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTerminate a call if a customer’s behaviour is unacceptable. We will not tolerate any telephone calls where the caller is aggressive, abusive or offensive to staff. We make a written record of all telephone calls\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLimit contact from the customer to telephone calls at set times, on set days\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRestrict contact to a nominated member of staff who will deal with all future telephone calls or correspondence from the customer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRestrict contact from the customer to writing only\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eReturn any documents to the customer or, file them and not respond\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTake any other action that we consider to be appropriate\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will always let the customer know what actions we are taking and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur Service Level Agreement with the relevant organisation sets out what we can and cannot look at. When we consider continued correspondence on a wide range of issues to be excessive, we will inform the customer that only those matters within our remit will be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn exceptional cases, we reserve the right to refuse to consider a complaint or future complaints from an individual. We will take into account the impact on the individual and also whether there would be a broader public interest in considering the complaint further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-process-we-follow-to-make-a-decision-about-unreasonable-behaviour\"\u003eThe process we follow to make a decision about unreasonable behaviour\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny member of our staff who directly experiences aggressive or abusive behaviour from a customer, has the authority to deal immediately with that behaviour in a manner they consider appropriate to the situation, and in line with this policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the exception of such immediate decisions taken at the time of an incident, decisions to restrict contact with the Adjudicator’s Office are only taken after careful consideration of the situation by a senior member of staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWherever possible, we will give a customer the opportunity to change their behaviour or actions before we take any action. We will inform the customer that we consider their behaviour is unacceptable (by reference to the policy) and warn them of the actions that we will take if they persist with their conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-we-let-people-know-that-we-have-made-this-decision\"\u003eHow do we let people know that we have made this decision?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a member of our staff makes an immediate decision in response to aggressive or abusive behaviour, the customer is advised at the time of the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a decision has been made by a senior member of staff, customers will always be informed in writing why a decision has been made to restrict future contact. Customers will also be informed what the restricted contact arrangements are, and if relevant, the length of time that these restrictions will be in place. This ensures that the customer has a record of the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-we-record-a-decision-to-restrict-contact\"\u003eHow do we record a decision to restrict contact?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will always record all incidents of unacceptable actions by customers. Where it is decided to restrict customer contact, an entry noting this and all letters confirming the situation with the customer will be kept on the relevant file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-we-review-a-decision-to-restrict-contact\"\u003eCan we review a decision to restrict contact?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, a customer can request a review of a decision to restrict contact. If a request is made, we will only consider arguments that relate to the restriction and not to either the complaint made to us, or to our decision to conclude a complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a customer could say that their actions were incorrectly identified as unacceptable, the restrictions were disproportionate, or that they will adversely impact on the individual because of personal circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have discretion to remove or alter the restrictions as we think best. Our decision will be based on the evidence available to us. We will advise the customer in writing that either the restricted contact arrangements still apply, or a different course of action has been agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"policy-availability\"\u003ePolicy availability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopies of this policy are available free online, and on request from the Adjudicator’s \nOffice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn request, this policy can be made available in other languages and formats (such as large print or Braille).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

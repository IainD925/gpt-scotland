Operators and transport managers are expected to complete continuous professional development to make sure they keep up to date with changes in legislation and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/senior-traffic-commissioners-statutory-guidance-and-statutory-directions\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSenior Traffic Commissioner’s Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions\u003c/a\u003e, this applies equally to transport consultants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should consider asking them for details of their professional qualifications (e.g. Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence), any accreditations they hold and whether they have ever been required to attend a public inquiry as a transport manager. You may wish to seek references from their previous clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions you should consider asking a transport consultant before instructing them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eare they signed up to receive news alerts from the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKOTC/subscriber/new\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etraffic commissioners\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKDVSA/subscriber/new\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDVSA\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eare they a member of a trade association, for example, Logistics UK, Road Haulage Association, British Association of Removers, Confederation of Passenger Transport\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eare they a member of a professional body, for example, Institute of Transport Administration, Charted Institute of Logistics and Transport, Society of Operations Engineers, Institute of Road Transport Engineers\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ehave they been to public inquiry and had action taken against their good repute as a transport manager\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003etheir last refresher training date\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"applying-for-a-licence\"\u003eApplying for a licence\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve decided to instruct a transport consultant you should expect them to conduct a challenging and searching interview about your business, this will be with the sole trader, partners or the statutory office holders of a limited company. The transport consultant should then be able to give you an assessment of the application, identify any potential issues which will need to be overcome and whether it is likely to be granted. The interview should also identify whether you require an interim, how you have met your transport needs to date, any prior involvement you have had with transport operations using vehicles exceeding 3.5 tonnes, and areas where you may need to evidence improved compliance following past breaches. This will help speed up the process once the application is submitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions that applicants should be prepared to answer include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ewhy does the business need the licence? Are you operating already? If you are already operating without the benefit of any licence or interim licence, you should be told to stop immediately. Traffic commissioners are entitled to conclude that a person does not have the required repute where they have decided to operate without authorisation (either on an interim or full licence) particularly in the face of warnings not to do so;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edo you have any convictions which must be disclosed? If in doubt the transport consultant should advise you to disclose them to the traffic commissioner so they can rule on their applicability;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edo you have any operator licence history? All operator licensing history should be disclosed no matter how old;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edo you have any familial or other links to previous licence holders? If so, the transport consultant should seek explanations of these links so that this information can be provided to the traffic commissioner to prevent delays;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ewhat is the source of the business’s finances? If a loan is being relied on, the transport consultant should ask for a copy of the agreement so the terms can be assessed. Are the finances in the name of the entity applying for the licence, if not they can only be considered in very limited circumstances  and will cause delay;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edoes the business have confirmation that they have access to an operating centre and is the operating centre suitable from both an environmental and road safety perspective?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eif a standard licence applicant, have you and the transport manager met and discussed how you will work together? Is there a contract in place with the individual rather than a company?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ehas the advert been made in time and in the correct newspaper?\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe above is not an exhaustive list. The transport consultant should review the entire application with at least one statutory director for limited companies and the transport manager before it is submitted. Transport consultants should bring to your attention any potential issues with the application so that these can be addressed before submission. Any requests for information from the Office of the Traffic Commissioner should be responded to promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the consultant submits the application on your behalf, you should ensure that this is made clear by ensuring:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe user details submitted are the consultant’s details, and not that of the applicant\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe user ID reflects the consultant’s business e.g. ABConsultants, Xsolicitors\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe e-mail address used must be the consultant’s business e-mail\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a transport consultant fails to comply with the above requirements or pretends to be the applicant, the user account may be terminated due to a breach of the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.vehicle-operator-licensing.service.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eVehicle Operator Licensing Terms and Conditions\u003c/a\u003e.

Every user with access must have their own account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"public-inquiries\"\u003ePublic Inquiries\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhilst traffic commissioners allow unqualified advocates to appear before them, this is always at the discretion of the presiding traffic commissioner. As with the courts, an unqualified representative must first seek permission well in advance of the hearing date to appear from a traffic commissioner. The transport consultant will need to satisfy the traffic commissioner that they have the relevant experience, no personal interest in the outcome of the case, no conflicts of interest may arise and that they understand the duty of confidentiality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic commissioners may refuse to hear representatives other than from regulated counsel or solicitors. This distinction is based on the fact that unlike that of other representatives the conduct of counsel and solicitors is regulated in England and Wales by the Bar Standards Board or the Solicitors Regulation Authority and in Scotland by the Law Society of Scotland or the Faculty of Advocates, and therefore the submissions from counsel and solicitors may carry more weight than those from other representatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransport consultants and representatives are expected to display a degree of competence and openness with the tribunal and if they fail in that regard, it is open to the traffic commissioner to indicate that the person will not be acceptable to act as an advocate at any public inquiry in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsultants are unable to act as both an advocate and witness in the same proceedings. You should be particularly mindful of this where a consultant has undertaken work with you to improve your compliance, and consider whether it may be more beneficial for them to act as a witness in the inquiry rather than attending as an advocate. The practice of seeking to appear as both advocate and witness has been disapproved of by the Upper Tribunal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"concerns\"\u003eConcerns\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you suspect that a transport consultant is not acting in your best interests, you should consider terminating your contract with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

Farmers must be careful to avoid soil erosion and overgrazing, as well as to observe Cross Compliance requirements. Help is available in the form of financial support through government-sponsored agri-environment schemes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is for upland farmers. It explains the sort of funding you may be eligible for, and the conditions you must meet to claim it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also provides advice on specific upland management issues such as grazing management, soil erosion, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and other protected landscape features, and explains uplands Cross Compliance requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"uplands-and-less-favoured-areas\"\u003eUplands and Less Favoured Areas\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no statutory definition of ‘uplands’, but it is generally accepted to refer to areas of mountain, moor and heath, high ground above the upper limits of enclosed farmland, largely covered by dry and wet dwarf shrub heath species and rough grassland. Hill farms also have adjacent land in the form of semi-improved and improved grassland that are used in conjunction with the moorland and rough grazing. All of this land needs to be sustainably managed in order to safeguard the valuable biodiversity of the plants and animals that can only thrive in these habitats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the English uplands can be found in the north and south-west of England, with a few other areas in the counties bordering Wales. They are nationally and internationally important for biodiversity, and have significant agricultural, landscape, archaeological, recreational, cultural and natural resource value. Agricultural activity shapes these valuable upland landscapes, and provides many of the tools to manage them. Without some form of management they would lose their environmental and landscape value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, hill farmers have carried out management of these areas, predominantly by grazing cattle and sheep. In recognition of their important role, the government provides specific funding to support upland farmers through Uplands Entry Level Stewardship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"less-favoured-area-lfa\"\u003eLess Favoured Area (\u003cabbr title=\"Less Favoured Area\"\u003eLFA\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Less Favoured Area\"\u003eLFA\u003c/abbr\u003e means land located and included in the list of less favoured areas adopted by Article 2 of European Council Directive No.75/268EEC on mountain and hill farming in less favoured areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the UK, \u003cabbr title=\"Less Favoured Areas\"\u003eLFAs\u003c/abbr\u003e have two distinct classifications - the Severely Disadvantaged Area (\u003cabbr title=\"Severely Disadvantaged Area\"\u003eSDA\u003c/abbr\u003e) or the Disadvantaged Area (\u003cabbr title=\"Disadvantaged Area\"\u003eDA\u003c/abbr\u003e).

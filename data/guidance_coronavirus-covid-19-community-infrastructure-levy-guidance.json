It has been updated to explain the operation of the ‘Community Infrastructure Levy (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020’ which came into force on 22 July 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has put in place a number of financial measures to help businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak which are explained on the financial support for business pages. However, it is recognised that smaller developers may need more help. This guidance explains the steps that local authorities may wish to consider to ease the financial burden on developers, including recent changes to the CIL Regulations, to help small and medium sized developers in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended) provide some flexibility for local authorities to defer the payment of CIL. We set out in May 2020 some of the steps that local authorities may wish to consider to ease the burden on developers. However, it was recognised that under the regulatory regime at that time, delaying payment would result, in some cases, in mandatory interest charges for the late payment of CIL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this, the government has amended the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 through the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/781/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCommunity Infrastructure Levy (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020\u003c/a\u003e to give authorities discretion, for a limited period, to defer CIL payments for small and medium sized developers without having to impose additional costs on them. The regulations came into force on 22 July 2020 and are  explained below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"instalment-policies\"\u003eInstalment policies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCIL charging authorities have the power under regulation 69B to allow those liable to CIL to pay the charge in one or more instalments and can set the date(s) on which each payment is due. This could be some time in the future. In the absence of such a policy, CIL is payable – in full – at the end of the period of 60 days beginning with the intended commencement date (see regulation 70(7)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCIL charging authorities can also bring into effect a new instalment policy at any time. However, any new instalment policy will only apply to chargeable developments commencing after the new instalment policy comes into effect. CIL is therefore payable in accordance with the instalment policy that was in place at the time of commencement of the chargeable development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor phased development, as each phase is a separate chargeable development, later phases that have not yet commenced could be subject to a new instalment policy. CIL charging authorities could therefore take advantage of this provision to introduce new instalment policies for as-yet un-commenced chargeable development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"enforcement\"\u003eEnforcement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCIL collecting authorities have discretion around how they deal with the late payment of CIL. This could provide some scope to ease the financial pressures on developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn normal circumstances, a CIL collecting authority might consider it expedient to stop development until the outstanding amount has been paid. The CIL regulations set out the procedure for issuing a CIL stop notice, contravention of which is an offence. However, decisions regarding whether and when to take such enforcement actions are at the discretion of the collecting authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, a CIL collecting authority has the ability under regulation 85 to impose surcharges on a person that has not paid CIL. However, the imposition of these surcharges is at the discretion of the authority. CIL collecting authorities can therefore choose not to impose the surcharge for late payment and are encouraged to consider using this discretion where appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the CIL regulations provide that late payment interest accrues automatically, starting from the day after the day payment was due (see regulation 87). The payment is calculated at an annual rate of 2.5% above the Bank of England base rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amendments to CIL introduced by the Community Infrastructure Levy (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 enable charging authorities to defer CIL payments; to temporarily disapply late payment interest and surcharge payments; and to provide a discretion to credit interest already charged where they consider it appropriate to do so. This may include interest that accrued in the period between the introduction of the lockdown and the regulatory changes coming into effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe measures now available to CIL authorities should give them confidence to use their enforcement powers with discretion and provide some comfort to developers that, where appropriate, they will not be charged extra for matters that were outside of their control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCIL charging authorities are therefore encouraged to consider making use of the ability to introduce an instalment policy (or amend an existing instalment policy); to use their discretion in considering what, if any, enforcement action is appropriate in respect of unpaid CIL liabilities; and to take a positive approach to their engagement with developers, to ensure CIL liabilities do not cause undue burdens over the period of disruption caused by the coronavirus\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"community-infrastructure-levy-coronavirus-amendment-england-regulations-2020\"\u003eCommunity Infrastructure Levy (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-the-purpose-of-this-guidance\"\u003eWhat is the purpose of this guidance?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance explains the changes made to the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 introduced by the Community Infrastructure Levy (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 (the ‘CIL Coronavirus Regulations’).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIL Coronavirus Regulations were introduced to supplement the financial measures that the government has put in place to help small and medium sized businesses during the coronavirus outbreak.

Any such SME who is (i) experiencing financial difficulties because of the effects of coronavirus and (ii)  having difficulty paying an amount of CIL (whether by instalment or otherwise) which is due (required to be paid) during the material period, may ask the CIL collecting authority to defer that CIL payment.

The developer should make a deferral request to the collecting authority, in writing, no more than 14 days before, or as soon as practicable after the date the CIL payment is due. The collecting authority can request whatever information from the developer they reasonably need to consider the deferral request.  The developer must provide that information, in so far as it is in their possession or control, within 14 days beginning with the day on which the request was made. The collecting authority can refuse to grant a request if the information is not provided within the specified time (regulation 72C).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe collecting authority must consider a deferral request as soon as practicable after it is received, and grant or refuse to grant the request in writing as soon as practicable, and in any event before the end of the period of 40 days beginning with the day the collecting authority receives the request.

The collecting authority may also wish to take further evidence into account if they consider that is relevant and reasonable.

The applicant must then comply with the demand notice that was served under regulation 69 before the deferral request was made; or where applicable, any revised demand notice which was served after the deferral request was made but which is not related to that deferral request.  Payment must be made within 7 days to avoid late payment interest. The legislation does not mandate that an authority must give reasons for refusing a deferral request, but the government expects that as a matter of good administrative practice, reasons should be provided wherever possible and reasonable to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-a-local-authority-signal-an-intention-to-defer-prior-to-the-formal-deferral-being-granted\"\u003eCan a local authority signal an intention to defer prior to the formal deferral being granted?’\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIL collecting authority and developer are encouraged to engage at an early stage and agree what evidence the developer should provide in support of their deferral request. The local authority is able to signal their inclination to grant a deferral in advance, although a deferral request must be formally applied for as soon as practicable after, or not earlier than 14 days before, the date on which the CIL payment is due.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-a-cil-payment-be-deferred-more-than-once\"\u003eCan a CIL payment be deferred more than once?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a deferred CIL payment becomes due during the ‘material period’ the applicant can apply for a further deferral for the same chargeable amount if the criteria mentioned in regulation 72A apply again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe applicant should make their new deferral request no earlier than 14 days before, or as soon as practicable after the CIL payment due date. The latest time for submission of a deferral request would be as soon as practicable after 31 July 2021 – which should be days or a few weeks after that cut-off date (not months).  The collecting authority should determine that the applicant still meets the eligibility criteria and can grant a further payment deferral of up to 6 months – even if this means the deferred payment date is after 31 July 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"late-interest\"\u003eCan late payment interest be waived?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collecting authority cannot charge late payment interest while it is determining a deferral request, and also during the agreed deferral period, late payment would not apply. However, there will be many cases where late payment interest accrued in the period between the start of lockdown (21 March 2020) and the CIL Coronavirus Regulations coming into force. The collecting authority must charge this interest in accordance with regulation 87, but the applicant may request that the collecting authority credits that interest payment against the CIL amount due under the revised demand notice which is required under regulation 72A(5). This is called “an interest request”. Late payment interest that accrued before 21 March 2020 cannot be credited against the CIL amount due.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if the collecting authority does not consider the interest request to be appropriate and refuses it, the applicant will be liable to pay the outstanding interest amount in accordance with the existing CIL Regulations 2010 (as amended).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"are-surcharges-payable-for-late-payment\"\u003eAre surcharges payable for late payment?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegulation 85 provides that the collecting authority may impose a surcharge where a person is liable to pay CIL and this amount is not received in full after the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the payment is due. The provision is therefore already discretionary and is unchanged by the CIL Coronavirus Regulations. The one change introduced by the CIL Coronavirus Regulations is that a surcharge cannot be imposed while the collecting authority is determining a deferral request (Regulation 72B(1)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"is-there-a-right-of-appeal-again-the-refusal-to-grant-a-deferral-or-to-credit-late-payment-interest\"\u003eIs there a right of appeal again the refusal to grant a deferral or to credit late payment interest?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIL charging authority has the discretion to grant a deferral request and to credit interest, if it considers that is appropriate. Charging authorities are encouraged to take a positive approach, and public law principles apply as this is an exercise of discretion, but there is no right of appeal in CIL Regulations, if the decision is taken to refuse the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-collecting-authorities-in-london-defer-mayoral-cil-and-grant-interest-requests\"\u003eCan collecting authorities in London defer Mayoral CIL and grant interest requests?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollecting authorities in London are required to collect CIL on behalf of the Mayor. They may only grant a deferral request for Mayoral CIL if the Mayor is of the view that it is appropriate for any CIL payment charged by the Mayor to be deferred (regulation 72A(6)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn relation to interest which has accrued on CIL charged by the Mayor, the collecting authority may only grant an interest request, if (i) the Mayor is of the view that it is appropriate for any CIL payment charged by the Mayor to be deferred under regulation 72A (see regulation 72B(4) and (ii) if the Mayor is of the view that it is appropriate for any late payment interest which has accrued on Mayoral CIL to be the subject of an interest request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"section-106\"\u003eSection 106\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are greater flexibilities within section 106 planning obligations than CIL. Where the delivery of a planning obligation, such as a financial contribution, is triggered during this period, local authorities are encouraged to consider whether it would be appropriate to allow the developer to defer delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeferral periods could be time-limited, or linked to the government’s wider legislative approach and the lifting of CIL easements (although in this case we would encourage the use of a back-stop date). Deeds of variation can be used to agree these changes. Local authorities should take a pragmatic and proportionate approach to the enforcement of section 106 planning obligations during this period. This should help remove barriers for developers and minimise the stalling of sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

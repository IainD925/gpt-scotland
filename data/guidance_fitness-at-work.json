Workers can spend up to three-quarters of their day sat down, which contributes to a range of preventable health conditions, including the two leading causes of workplace absence: back injuries and stress, depression or anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016/17, 1.3 million workers suffered from work-related ill-health, which equated to 25.7 million working days lost.  This has been estimated to cost £522 per employee, and up to £32 billion per year for UK business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHelping your staff to be physically active at work can bring a number of benefits to you as an employer and doesn’t have to be difficult. This guidance provides some advice you can put into practice straight away to help your workforce become healthier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-benefits-of-physical-activity\"\u003eThe benefits of physical activity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne in four people are physically inactive despite the fact that regular physical activity has been shown to treat, manage and prevent up to twenty different lifestyle-related conditions, including heart disease, cancers, stroke and diabetes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany employees struggle to fit physical activity into their busy working days but being active for just one hour can offset the potential harm of being inactive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can take a number of steps to help your employees become more active at work, and save money as a result of a healthier, more productive workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNearly half of people say cheaper facilities would encourage them to be more active along with having time to fit this into their working day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-the-uk-tax-system-can-help-support-more-employees-to-be-active\"\u003eHow the UK Tax system can help support more employees to be active:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government introduced Cycle to Work in 1999 - an annual tax exemption that allows you to loan bicycles and cycle safety equipment to employees as a tax-free benefit. This has had a positive impact on workplace health and employee motivation, and has encouraged new groups of people to take up physical activity.  This guidance builds on Cycle to Work, providing suggestions to help you further support your staff to be active.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSupporting employees to be more active during the working day can easily be achieved at no extra cost to you.  The UK’s tax system is set up to allow employees to easily access discounts – negotiated on their behalf by you – through a deduction of their net pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to offering reduced price gym facilities in or near work, there are two options:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"providing-your-own-tax-free-recreational-or-sports-facilities\"\u003eProviding your own tax-free recreational or sports facilities:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a larger organisation, you may be able to offer a gym or leisure facility for staff in your workplace. These in-house facilities can either be run by your organisation directly or by a third-party provider, and can be offered to employees to access for free or on a paid-for basis.  In-house gym facilities can be offered to employees tax-free at a convenient location to fit in around work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"securing-a-corporate-discount-for-employees\"\u003eSecuring a corporate discount for employees:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an employer you may be able to negotiate with local gyms and leisure centres to secure a discounted membership rate to pass on to your employees – this can be up to 20% - 30% cheaper than the normal price.  This can vary by provider, and size of your organisation, so make sure to talk to all the potential sites in your local area to find the best deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-steps-can-employers-take\"\u003eWhat steps can employers take?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"providing-your-own-tax-free-recreational-or-sports-facilities-1\"\u003eProviding your own tax-free recreational or sports facilities:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on your circumstances, you can choose to provide facilities such as workplace gyms, clubhouses, playing fields or courts for your employees, or you can join up with other employers. As long as the facilities meet \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/expenses-benefits-sporting-recreational-facilities/whats-exempt\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecertain conditions\u003c/a\u003e, it will not be a taxable benefit in kind (BiK) and no tax or National Insurance contributions (NICs) is charged.

This is a taxable BiK and will need to be reported to HMRC through the P11D form or payroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information visit \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/expenses-benefits-sporting-recreational-facilities/whats-exempt\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethis website\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"providing-gym-membership-for-your-employees\"\u003eProviding gym membership for your employees:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmployers can negotiate corporate discounts for their staff at nearby gyms and leisure facilities.  Depending on how you pay for the cost of the gym membership, the payment is either taxed as earnings or a taxable BiK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eYou pay Ruby an extra £30 cash each month to pay for her gym membership. This is taxed as earnings through PAYE.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eYou pay £30 for Ruby’s gym membership each month. This is a taxable BiK and you should report on the P11D form to HMRC or through the payroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"no-cost-benefits-in-kind-and-making-good\"\u003eNo cost Benefits in Kind and Making Good:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you pay for a gym membership and your employee contributes towards the cost from their net pay (after tax and NICs), this is referred to as ‘making good’. The amount of the benefit (cost of gym membership) is reduced by the amount of the contribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.You pay £30 from your company bank account each month for Luke’s gym membership, so he has received a taxable BiK of £30 (£360 a year). If Luke decides to pay you £30, he has ‘made good’ the benefit in total. \nYou have not incurred the cost of providing the benefit. Luke’s contribution is taken as a deduction from his net pay so does not need to make separate arrangements with his bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Luke has ‘made good’ the benefit you do not need to report this to HMRC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf Luke decides to contribute £15 towards the cost, he will have ‘made good’ the benefit by this amount. Luke has received a benefit of £15, or £180 a year, and you will need to report this on the payroll or on the P11D form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.You negotiate a discount of £10 per month at the local gym and arrange membership for all your employees at £40 per head instead of the usual £50, which you pay for each month. \u003cbr\u003e\nYour employees have received a taxable BiK of £40 each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your employees agree to have £40 deducted from their net pay each month, they have ‘made good’ the cost of you providing the benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe discount itself is not a taxable BiK as you have not incurred an expense in obtaining the discounted gym membership, so there is nothing to report to HMRC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"salary-sacrifice-or-optional-remuneration-arrangements-opra\"\u003eSalary Sacrifice or Optional Remuneration Arrangements (OpRA):\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, there are no tax or National Insurance savings, either for you or your employees, if you provide benefits through a Salary Sacrifice or OpRA.

This consideration – typically referred to as the ‘Habitats Regulations Assessment screening’ – should take into account the potential effects both of the plan/project itself and in combination with other plans or projects.

The competent authority may agree to the plan or project only after having ruled out adverse effects on the integrity of the habitats site. Where an adverse effect on the site’s integrity cannot be ruled out, and where there are no alternative solutions, the plan or project can only proceed if there are imperative reasons of over-riding public interest and if the necessary compensatory measures can be secured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 001 Reference ID: 65-001-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-may-appropriate-assessments-be-required-in-the-planning-process\"\u003eWhen may appropriate assessments be required in the planning process?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a proposed plan or project is considered likely to have a significant effect on a protected \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/annex-2-glossary\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehabitats site\u003c/a\u003e (either individually or in combination with other plans or projects) then an appropriate assessment of the implications for the site, in view of the site’s conservation objectives, must be undertaken (\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/part/6/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePart 6 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017\u003c/a\u003e).

Mitigation measures are protective measures forming part of a project and are intended to avoid or reduce any direct adverse effects that may be caused by a plan or project, to ensure that it does not have an adverse effect on the integrity of a habitats site(s). Any measures used to inform the decision about the effects on the integrity need to be sufficiently secured and likely to work in practice. Measures aimed at compensating for the negative effects of a project cannot be considered mitigation measures.

The judgment clarified that when making screening decisions for the purposes of deciding whether an appropriate assessment is required, competent authorities cannot take into account any mitigation measures\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, a competent authority may only take account of mitigation measures intended to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of a plan or project as part of an appropriate assessment itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a departure from the approach established by domestic case law, which had permitted mitigation measures to be taken into account at the screening stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 005 Reference ID: 65-005-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-are-the-key-principles-which-can-be-considered-by-competent-authorities-when-considering-whether-appropriate-assessment-is-required\"\u003eWhat are the key principles which can be considered by competent authorities when considering whether appropriate assessment is required?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"measures-which-have-been-specifically-added-to-achieve-the-purpose-of-avoiding-or-reducing-its-harmful-effects-on-a-habitats-site-should-not-be-considered-at-the-screening-stage\"\u003eMeasures which have been specifically added to achieve the purpose of avoiding or reducing its harmful effects on a habitats site should not be considered at the screening stage.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne way of determining whether measures should not be considered at the screening stage may be to consider whether the particular aspects have been included primarily to mitigate the likely habitats-related effects on the site.  If they have, this may suggest that an appropriate assessment is required.  In many cases, this may not give rise to significant practical difficulties since, if the measures proposed are sufficiently robust and achieve the required certainty then they will be considered as not giving rise to an adverse effect on integrity of the site at appropriate assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, it would appear that off-site Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspaces may be considered as a mitigation measure under People over Wind as their primary purpose is to draw recreational pressure away from sites and so prevent an adverse effect from occurring.  In these cases the competent authority must now assess the robustness of mitigation measures through an appropriate assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 006 Reference ID: 65-006-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"features-that-are-integral-to-the-design-or-physical-characteristics-of-the-project-that-is-being-assessed-for-example-the-layout-timing-and-location-of-a-scheme-may-be-considered-at-the-screening-stage\"\u003eFeatures that are integral to the design or physical characteristics of the project that is being assessed, for example, the layout, timing and location of a scheme, may be considered at the screening stage.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not something is integral to the project and not a mitigation measure will have to be determined on a case by case basis on its particular characteristics at the screening stage.  Some features of a plan or project may be the product of other considerations, irrespective of any nature conservation issues, for example safety considerations. The design of a development may also have been devised to take account of the distance from or relationship to the site and intervening physical matters. A competent authority may wish to consider whether the measures have been included in a plan or project only to respond to likely effects on a habitats site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 007 Reference ID: 65-007-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-a-project-or-non-strategic-plan-such-as-a-neighbourhood-plan-rely-on-a-more-strategic-level-appropriate-assessment-such-as-that-undertaken-for-a-local-plan\"\u003eCan a project or non-strategic plan, such as a neighbourhood plan, rely on a more strategic level appropriate assessment such as that undertaken for a local plan?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn appropriate assessment for a more strategic plan, such as the local plan, can consider the impacts on sites and confirm the suitability or likely success of mitigation measures for associated non-strategic policies and projects. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn individual assessment of non-strategic policies and projects may not be necessary in some limited cases where the strategic appropriate assessment is sufficiently robust. This would need to contain complete, precise and definitive findings and conclusions capable of removing all reasonable scientific doubt on the impacts of the non-strategic policies (e.g. neighbourhood plans) and/or project(s).  As long as these measures have been properly considered in a recent plan, and the development will not create additional risks of a significant effect on a habitats site, they may not need further assessment at the non-strategic level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a high standard to meet and will need to be assessed on a case by case basis.

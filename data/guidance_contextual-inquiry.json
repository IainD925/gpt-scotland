However, human memory can be unreliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA study designed using contextual inquiry tries to overcome this issue by observing people in their context while inquiring (observing and questioning). This helps the researcher gain a comprehensive understanding of what users do in their environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse contextual inquiry to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einform product or service development (formative or iterative evaluation)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edevelop a new feature for your digital product\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ethnographic-study-qualitative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eethnographic studies\u003c/a\u003e, contextual inquiry investigates how your potential users interact with their natural environment rather than just focusing on your digital product.

The length of a contextual inquiry can vary from an hour to several days, depending on participants’ availability and the complexity of the processes you are trying to understand. The 4 basic principles of planning and conducting contextual inquiry are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"context\"\u003e1. Context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConduct your study in the natural environment to understand the user in the real world. The influences of immediate physical environment, as well as psychological, historical, cultural and social factors, cannot be underestimated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"focus\"\u003e2. Focus\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBe clear about your research aims and objectives and what you want to get out of the session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"partnership\"\u003e3. Partnership\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned in the previous point, knowing what you want to get out of the session is important. However, you should still be flexible and open. Participants should feel that they can direct the researcher towards what they consider to be important aspects of their life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"interpretation\"\u003e4. Interpretation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outcome of contextual inquiry is a shared understanding of participant’s working or other practices. You achieve this by observing, enquiring and building an understanding of a participant’s world, checking with the participant by asking for clarification and confirmation until you build a comprehensive picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"understanding-the-context\"\u003eUnderstanding the context\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour goal as a researcher is to understand the participant and how different forces influence their actions, working practices and processes. These can be external forces, like their physical environments, their family or work colleagues, and the wider environment that impacts on what they do. Internal forces include their attitudes, values, knowledge, reasoning and motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough observing and interviewing, you may uncover what is often implicit or invisible but may be important for designing an intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with any research, start by making participants feel at ease, introduce yourself and explain what will happen. Discuss confidentiality, what they should expect and whether you plan to film or record their actions. Make sure to take notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExplain to the participant how the session will work:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou will observe their actions, for example their work, in order to learn. Your role is to observe, learn and understand while they go about doing their tasks.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou will sometimes interrupt them to ask for clarification and explanation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey should let you know if you have interrupted at an inconvenient time and they would prefer to wait before answering the question (for example, they want to complete an action first)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-interrupt-to-ask-questions\"\u003eWhen to interrupt to ask questions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should interrupt the participant if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethey do something you don’t immediately understand\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou think you understand their process but you want to confirm it with the participant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBe aware of your participant going into interview mode. It is important to guide them back to the task at hand as uninterrupted as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the process, the researcher and the participant develop a shared interpretation of the work. At the end of the session, review your notes and present your understanding of the process you’ve been researching to the participant. They may clarify and correct your understanding of their working practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with any qualitative data analysis, use a systematic approach to analyse the data, for example \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analyse-your-data-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ethematic analysis\u003c/a\u003e. The analysis can be subjective, so it is good practice for 2 researchers to conduct the analysis and compare results. You could assemble a multidisciplinary team to share the results, interpret what they mean and create actionable recommendations for design solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-exploring-interruptions-and-distractions-while-completing-a-task--a-contextual-inquiry\"\u003eExample: exploring interruptions and distractions while completing a task – a contextual inquiry\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBorghouts and others (2020), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342759279_TimeToFocus_Feedback_on_Interruption_Durations_Discourages_Distractions_and_Shortens_Interruptions\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eTimeToFocus: Feedback on Interruption Durations Discourages Distractions and Shortens Interruptions\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is common to be interrupted while completing a task. This can be detrimental, for example, by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edecreasing efficiency\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eincreasing mistakes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einducing stress\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers aimed to understand more about how people deal with interruptions and distractions while working. They conducted a contextual inquiry with 9 office workers doing financial administration at public universities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey chose a task that was frequent and common to all participants: data entry related to processing an expense claim. In fact, processing the claim often required disruptions as additional resources were often needed, either in physical or digital form. The sessions lasted from 2 to 2.5 hours and they were audio- and video-recorded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach session started with an interview. This helped the participant to feel at ease and helped the researchers to understand the participant’s job role and their strategies for coping with interruptions. Then, participants were asked to talk while they processed an expense claim, using think aloud (link). The researcher observed the participant while they were working. The researchers summarised the findings, asking for confirmation or clarification when needed. If any parts of the process needed further clarification, researchers consulted the video recording to aid shared and comprehensive understanding of the working practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers found that, although participants try to prepare access to the additional resources that will help them to complete data entry for processing an expense claim, they often needed resources that they did not anticipate, both physical and digital. They then made a decision on the spot on whether they should interrupt the task to find more information or postpone the interruption till later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, interrupting a task to get additional digital resources was treated differently to interruptions to get physical resources. Participants seemed to be more likely to interrupt their task to retrieve digital resources. They often perceived that digital resources would be easier and faster to locate, but in fact, participants often took longer than they intended to locate them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis contextual inquiry led to 3 main design implications that were used to design a digital product to help manage interruptions online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth Foundation (2014) for more information about \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/newsletter/what-context-and-why-does-it-matter\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehow context matters when developing an intervention\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGOV.UK user research blog describing an example of \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/02/researching-in-context/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eusing contextual inquiry in practice\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGOV.UK user research blog \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/12/how-were-using-contextual-research-to-improve-gov-uk-notify/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHow we’re using contextual research to improve GOV.UK Notify\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eViitanen (2011), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/14314\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eContextual Inquiry Method for User-Centred Clinical IT System Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"examples-of-contextual-inquiry-in-digital-health\"\u003eExamples of contextual inquiry in digital health\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHerrmann and others (2017), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-017-9555-y\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWatts your usage?

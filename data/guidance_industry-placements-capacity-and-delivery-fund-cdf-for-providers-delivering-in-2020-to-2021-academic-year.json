Industry placements must be undertaken in a physical workplace environment and therefore placements are not currently permitted to be done remotely or virtually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise however, that industry placement delivery continues to be impacted by COVID-19.  In view of this continuing challenge, we will apply the same flexibility for the 2020 to 2021 academic year as we did in the 2019 to 2020 academic year.   In the 2020 to 2021 academic year, funding for CDF will not be clawed back if you are unable to meet your previously agreed target for the completion of industry placements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe anticipate that you will continue to work to secure as many industry placements as possible for the remainder of the 2020 to 2021 academic year.  The relaxation of the targets is on the assumption that you can demonstrate CDF has, and is continuing to support future delivery of quality industry placements.  Activity to support delivery of industry placements should include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe continued engagement with employers across different industries and develop engagement strategies for different industries\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epreparation for students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ealignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edevelopment of matching processes for appropriate student placements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will ask for evidence of these activities through the usual CDF monitoring process. \nWe will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the ability of providers to deliver placements throughout the remainder of the 2020 to 2021 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will still look to claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate that they have continued to support the delivery of quality industry placements and have not used the funding for the purpose intended. Providers must avoid the risk of double funding through the CDF and the furlough scheme, we will seek to claw back funding should providers furlough staff involved in these activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, you can be assured that funding for the 2020 to 2021 academic year will not be clawed back if you are unable to meet your 25% delivery target for the completion of industry placements in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, so long as you can demonstrate that the CDF has and is continuing to support future delivery of quality industry placements\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"new-delivery-models-for-industry-placements\"\u003eNew delivery models for industry placements\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor delivery in 2020 to 2021 academic year, we have updated some of the core principles that apply to T Level industry placements and introduced new models for the way industry placements can be delivered in the Construction and Engineering \u0026amp; Manufacturing routes, to reflect modern practices. These changes also apply to CDF industry placements and more information can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eindustry placements delivery guidance\u003c/a\u003e on GOV.UK.  Providers are expected to comply with this guidance for placements delivered in the 2020 to 2021 academic year onwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"delivering-cdf-industry-placements-over-2-academic-years\"\u003eDelivering CDF industry placements over 2 academic years\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the 2020 to 2021 academic year, providers are able to deliver industry placements across 2 academic years where the student is on a 2-year programme. All industry placements must commence in the first year of a student’s study programme (and during the CDF year funded), with the expectation that a minimum of 50% of a provider’s placements being successfully completed by the end of the 2020 to 2021 academic year. The remainder of industry placements would need to be successfully completed by the end of 2021 to 2022 academic year, but they still form part of the 2020 to 2021 academic year target and cannot count towards delivery targets set for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCDF is now in its third year of delivery. CDF is provided to facilitate the build-up of capacity and capability to deliver substantial industry placements. The number of industry placements successfully delivered in the previous 2 academic years is encouraging. Following on from this, we do expect that the number of successful industry placements will increase year on year in readiness for T Level roll out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFunding for CDF was included in allocation statements for 2020 to 2021 academic year, as were the number of funded students and the minimum number of placements to be delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"to-2021-academic-year-monitoring-requirements\"\u003e2020 to 2021 academic year monitoring requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the 2020 to 2021 academic year, monitoring returns are required to be submitted as a condition of funding, these are required by the 1 December 2020 and 11 June 2021.  These provide us with information on the progress being made in building capacity and capability to deliver high quality, substantial industry placements as we scale up the delivery of T Levels. They also provide assurance that the funding is being used for the purpose intended and they also support the planning of future CDF funding allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWhere information supplied in the December return is not sufficient, providers may need to submit a further return asking for more information on how funds have been utilised. This will be required by 1 March 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate they have continued to support the development of industry placements and used the funding for the purpose intended in their monitoring returns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitoring returns are compulsory, should you fail to submit a monitoring return, you may be in breach of your funding agreement and your CDF allocation may be at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dfe-sign-in-account-and-access-to-the-monitoring-form\"\u003eDfE Sign-in account and access to the monitoring form\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo access the monitoring form, you must sign into your DfE Sign-in account. We strongly advise you to check that your DfE Sign-in details are valid and that you have the appropriate permissions to access DfE Sign-in in advance of the deadline of the first monitoring form due by 1 December 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do not currently have an account, then you will need to create a DfE Sign-in account. Once you have an account, then the service ‘Online Collection Service’ and role ‘Industry Placements CDF Monitoring’ will need to be added to your account by a DfE Sign-in Approver at your organisation. Once you have access to the monitoring form, then on the DfE Sign-in page, enter your email address and password. This will take you to the Services page where you will need to choose ‘Industry Placements CDF Monitoring’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have access to the DfE Sign-in account, you will then be directed to the relevant monitoring form. Open the monitoring form and complete the relevant sections. There is a save and return function if you would like to revisit your responses before you submit. Once you have answered the questions in the monitoring form, please submit your responses. You will then be sent an email confirmation with a pdf attachment containing your monitoring form responses. You can also sign back in at any time to view your responses by logging on to your DfE Sign-in account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"qualifying-providers\"\u003eQualifying providers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders funded by the ESFA for 16 to 19 study programmes with qualifying students as defined below were eligible to apply for CDF. This inclusive approach allows almost all providers currently offering vocational programmes that could evolve into one of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/technical-education-overhaul-unveiled-by-skills-minister\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etechnical education routes\u003c/a\u003e to receive an allocation. CDF allocations made for 2020 to 2021 academic year were based on the number of qualifying students enrolled with each provider in 2018 to 2019 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo qualify for funding providers needed to have an Ofsted overall effectiveness grading of “Requires Improvement” or better. We based the Level of funding for each provider on the number of qualifying full-time students, at a rate of £250 per student enrolled on eligible programmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders should be clear that access to the CDF in the current year does not imply future eligibility to deliver or receive funding for the development or delivery of T Levels. We will monitor delivery of industry placements in 2020 to 2021 academic year via the monitoring forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"qualifying-students\"\u003eQualifying students\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo calculate CDF allocations for 2020 to 2021 academic year we used actual year-end 2018 to 2019 academic year data to calculate qualifying student numbers and delivery targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA list of qualification types used to identify qualifying students is set out below. It should be noted that general vocational qualifications were included in calculating eligible student numbers but \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2019-performance-tables-technical-and-vocational-qualifications/applied-general-qualifications\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eapplied general qualifications\u003c/a\u003e (AGQs) were not.

Providers have been notified of the minimum number of industry placement they must deliver for students on either a Level 2 or a Level 3 programme for delivery in the 2020 to 2021 academic year.  Only qualifications in the relevant SSAs or from the eligible AGQ list will count towards the target. We will be reviewing the data to cross refer the number of placements providers have recorded in the ILR or school census against the data provided in monitoring forms. Providers must ensure that each industry placement is recorded correctly, showing the start and end date, and the number of planned hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe learning aim reference number on the ILR and the school census specifically for recording CDF industry placements is ZWRKX002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCDF industry placements must take place on top of the existing study programme hours and CDF funding is allocated in addition to mainstream funding for qualifying students. Therefore, industry placement hours must not be included in the planned hours recorded for the study programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also important to note that, where hours are currently spent on work experience that is an existing and compulsory part of the qualification hours in a study programme, these work experience hours cannot be counted towards the industry placement hours delivered through CDF because providers are already being funded for these through mainstream funding. For the placement to be counted, students would need to do the required industry placement hours (minimum of 315) on top of any hours for the existing work experience that are recorded as planned ‘qualification hours’ on the ILR and school census.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose students that were on an industry placement in the 2019 to 2020 academic year that are yet to be completed can continue the aims recorded in 2019 to 2020 academic year into 2020 to 2021 academic year, however providers are not able to record any new students on the old aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders that have been selected to deliver T Levels from 2020 to 2021 must undertake a substantial industry placement, but these cannot be counted in the CDF target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eT Level industry placements must be recorded using the learning aim reference number ZWRKX003.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis learning aim reference is specifically for T Level industry placement activity and that code must not be used for CDF industry placements.

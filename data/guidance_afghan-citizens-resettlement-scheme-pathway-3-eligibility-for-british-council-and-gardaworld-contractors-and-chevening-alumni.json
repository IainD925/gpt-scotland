This includes in particular individuals who were contracted to take on regular and public-facing roles, providing services or benefits to beneficiaries on behalf of the British Council, and who were therefore closely associated with delivering the UK government’s mission in Afghanistan. A British Council contractor does not include those contracted to provide professional services such as accounting, marketing, maintenance of office equipment, directly or via a third party, nor does it include those representing the British Council as a commercial agent, for example for the recruitment of examination candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"gardaworld-contractors\"\u003eGardaWorld contractors\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eFor the purposes of Pathway 3 of the \u003cabbr title=\"Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme\"\u003eACRS\u003c/abbr\u003e a GardaWorld contractor is someone employed by GardaWorld on host country terms and conditions, for a period of 3 months or more after 1 July 2020, exclusively to support the British Embassy Kabul contract.

However, our Immigration Rules do not provide for someone to apply to come to the UK to seek asylum, temporary refuge, or humanitarian protection. Whilst we acknowledge the situation in Afghanistan is complex, the UK is not required to consider asylum or protection claims from the very large numbers of people overseas who might like to come to the UK to resettle. People who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach – that is the fastest route to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are additional safe and legal routes for people to come to the UK, for example should they wish to join family members here, or for work or study. These people would need to meet the relevant Immigration Rule requirements that they were applying under. This would enable them to qualify for a visa, meet the requirements to provide biometrics, and pay the relevant fee (or obtain the necessary waiver).

The \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Services and Markets Act 2000\"\u003eFSMA\u003c/abbr\u003e came into force on 1 December 2001 and replaced the previous law regulating insurance, the Insurance Companies Act 1982.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe provisions of the \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Services and Markets Act 2000\"\u003eFSMA\u003c/abbr\u003e make it illegal for UK businesses to effect contracts of insurance without being authorised to do so (with the exception of certain bodies specifically granted exemption from the need for authorisation). The regulation of companies and unincorporated bodies under section 19 of the \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Services and Markets Act 2000\"\u003eFSMA\u003c/abbr\u003e is carried out by the Financial Conduct Authority (\u003cabbr title=\"Financial Conduct Authority\"\u003eFCA\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Services and Markets Act 2000\"\u003eFSMA\u003c/abbr\u003e (Regulated Activities Order) 2001 defines the activities that are subject to regulation under the Act.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (\u003cabbr title=\"Court of Justice of the European Union\"\u003eCJEU\u003c/abbr\u003e) in the case of Card Protection Plan Ltd (\u003cabbr title=\"Card Protection Plan Ltd\"\u003eCPP\u003c/abbr\u003e), however found that the UK could not restrict its VAT exemption to authorised insurers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that insurance supplied by unauthorised insurers is exempt from VAT.

We’re aware that the term can be used within the insurance industry to mean other types of policy. We’re also aware that other terms, like ‘master policy’ can be used to describe the type of policy held by \u003cabbr title=\"Card Protection Plan Ltd\"\u003eCPP\u003c/abbr\u003e. It’s important therefore to be clear what’s meant by the term ‘block policy’ when used by us with reference to the \u003cabbr title=\"Court of Justice of the European Union\"\u003eCJEU\u003c/abbr\u003e decision in \u003cabbr title=\"Card Protection Plan Ltd\"\u003eCPP\u003c/abbr\u003e and its wider implications for the insurance exemption in this area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main characteristics of a block policy are that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere’s a contract between the block policyholder and the insurer which allows the block policyholder to effect insurance cover subject to certain conditions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe block policyholder, acting in their own name, procures insurance cover for third parties from the insurer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere’s a contractual relationship between the block policyholder and third parties under which the insurance is procured\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe block policyholder stands in place of the insurer in effecting the supply of insurance to the third parties\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis type of policy is commonly used within the industry. It’s often taken out by a supplier of goods or services to cover a number of small transactions over a set period, for example, a removal company may take out a block policy to provide its customers with insurance against the risk of damage to their belongings during the house move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlock or ‘master’ policies are also used by membership bodies to effect insurance cover on behalf of their members, for example, a pony club may arrange insurance under a block policy to provide their members with cover against the risk of injury or liability for another’s injury whilst taking part in equestrian events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes a block policy will cover the risks of the block policyholder as well as those of their customers, for example, a removal company could take out a policy to provide cover for both its own risk of damaging its customers’ property as well as its customers’ risk of damage to their property for which the removal company is not liable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA block insurance policy will normally name the business taking out the policy as the ‘policy holder’ with the ‘persons insured’ shown as the customers of the policyholder. Sometimes the contract will name the ‘persons insured’ as the business taking out the policy and its customers, without actually naming each individual customer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe premium paid by the policyholder to the insurer is calculated on the basis of the previous years trading with adjustments made at the end of the year when the exact number of persons insured under the policy is known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"vat-implications-for-supplies-made-by-block-policyholders\"\u003e2.5.2 VAT implications for supplies made by block policyholders\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlock policyholders supply VAT exempt insurance transactions as principals rather than insurance related services as intermediaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that if you’re a block policyholder, the whole consideration you receive in respect of your own services and the purchase of the insurance cover for your customers becomes income of your business, rather than just the amount of any commission or fee you receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis could have implications for the calculation of recoverable input tax under your partial exemption method, see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/partial-exemption-vat-notice-706\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePartial exemption (VAT Notice 706)\u003c/a\u003e.\nThere could also be implications for the VAT treatment of supplies you make which consist of insurance transactions with other goods or services, this is explained in \u003ca href=\"#block-policy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eparagraph 4.6\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"vat-and-particular-supplies-of-insurance\"\u003e3.

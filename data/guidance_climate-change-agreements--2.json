In return, operators receive a discount on the Climate Change Levy (\u003cabbr title=\"Climate Change Levy\"\u003eCCL\u003c/abbr\u003e), a tax added to electricity and fuel bills. The Environment Agency administers the \u003cabbr title=\"climate change agreement\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e scheme on behalf of the whole of the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you hold a \u003cabbr title=\"climate change agreement\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e you will get a discount on your \u003cabbr title=\"Climate Change Levy\"\u003eCCL\u003c/abbr\u003e.

The targets were then included in umbrella agreements held between sector associations and the Environment Agency. Umbrella agreements also list the processes that are eligible for a \u003cabbr title=\"climate change agreement\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e.

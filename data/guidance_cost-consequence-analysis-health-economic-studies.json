It includes all types of effects, including health, non-health, negative and positive effects, both to patients and other parties (for example, caregivers).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"cost consequence analysis\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e aims to give decision makers a comprehensive summary of the different costs and effects, so it tends to take a broad perspective.

For instance, some decision makers may decide to take the perspective of the NHS and only consider costs to the healthcare system and health benefits to the patient. Others may take a broader perspective, such as a societal perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecision makers will need to choose their own weighting system to decide whether the benefits of your digital product are worth the possible additional cost. For example, some decision makers may place higher value on the effects of your product on reducing health inequalities, whereas others may be mostly interested in how your product enables them to deliver healthcare more efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse a cost consequence analysis when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyour digital product is being piloted and it is unclear what costs and effects will be most relevant to decision makers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’re evaluating a complex digital product that has multiple effects – for example health and non-health benefits – that would be difficult to combine into a single measure\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe decision maker is particularly interested in the impact of your digital product on broader patient-oriented outcomes, such as patient wellbeing and satisfaction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pros\"\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBenefits of \u003cabbr title=\"cost consequence analysis\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit gives you a simple broken-down (disaggregated) summary of costs and effects of your digital product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edecision makers can choose the combination of costs and effects that are most relevant to their context, and apply their own weighting to the effects\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can include a broader range of effects than other analyses, such as user experience and convenience of care\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cons\"\u003eCons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDrawbacks of \u003cabbr title=\"cost consequence analysis\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edecisions made at the individual decision maker level may not always be in the best interest of patients or society\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"cost consequence analysis\"\u003eCCA\u003c/abbr\u003e results may be less generalizable because the choice of relevant costs and effects and the weighting attached to them is often context-specific\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einterpretation of the results tends to be more subjective than other forms of economic evaluation, and there is scope for cherry-picking positive results\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-a-cost-consequence-analysis\"\u003eHow to carry out a cost consequence analysis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should follow the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/economic-evaluation-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egeneral points for any economic evaluation study\u003c/a\u003e.

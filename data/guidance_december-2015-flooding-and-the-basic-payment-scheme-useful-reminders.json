Keepers should contact \u003cabbr title=\"Animal and Plant Health Agency\"\u003eAPHA\u003c/abbr\u003e on 03000 200 301.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLivestock keepers affected by the floods may not be able to report livestock births, movements and deaths within regulatory deadlines and this has the potential to affect cross compliance. Keepers should update their farm records and report their animal births, movements, and deaths as soon as practically possible. They should contact \u003cabbr title=\"British Cattle Movement Service\"\u003eBCMS\u003c/abbr\u003e if they have any problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCross compliance rules state that penalties may not be applied if a non-compliance is as a result of ‘force majeure’ or exceptional circumstances. Livestock keepers wishing to use these provisions should write to RPA within 15 working days of being able to do so, setting out the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"tb-testing-delays\"\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"Tuberculosis\"\u003eTB\u003c/abbr\u003e testing delays\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviding cattle keepers tell \u003cabbr title=\"Animal and Plant Health Agency\"\u003eAPHA\u003c/abbr\u003e they have not or cannot complete their \u003cabbr title=\"Tuberculosis\"\u003eTB\u003c/abbr\u003e test due to flooding, no cross compliance action will be triggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"other-cross-compliance-requirements\"\u003eOther Cross Compliance requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor there to be a breach of cross compliance, any action or inaction must be directly attributable to the farmer. This will safeguard farmers in respect of many of the potential non-compliances they are currently facing.  For example, if landscape features protected by \u003cabbr title=\"Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions\"\u003eGAECs\u003c/abbr\u003e such as stone walls or hedgerows are washed away or Public Rights of Way may have become obstructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers are also reminded that under the \u003cabbr title=\"Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions\"\u003eGAECs\u003c/abbr\u003e, they are exempt from the rules where any action is carried out by statutory body acting under its statutory authority. For example utility companies carrying out electricity, water, gas or highway works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the \u003cabbr title=\"Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions\"\u003eGAECs\u003c/abbr\u003e already include exemptions that allow works to be carried out in emergency situations. For example, cutting or trimming trees where they are damaged and are a risk to people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers are also exempt from a GAEC rule under the following circumstances;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eissues of human or animal health or safety\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhen they need to control or treat serious causes of harm to plant health\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eserious pest or weed infestations\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers don’t need to write to RPA asking for an exemption.\nAlso, derogations can be granted on a case by case basis and these will particularly apply under the GAEC soils rules where they cannot be met:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhere the environment would benefit\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efor livestock or crop production\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eimproving public or agricultural access\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers must apply in writing for a derogation from RPA.

Use photos and/or a written record of the issues. Farmers can show these to RPA if they are inspected at a later date, so we can see how they were affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"land-eligibility-and-force-majeure\"\u003eLand eligibility and ‘Force Majeure’\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlooded land is still eligible for \u003cabbr title=\"Basic Payment Scheme\"\u003eBPS\u003c/abbr\u003e if the flooding is temporary and the land would otherwise still be available for agricultural activity. RPA expect the land would be returned to agricultural use as soon as practically possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of flooding could be regarded as permanent if the land can no longer be considered as ‘eligible’ for \u003cabbr title=\"Basic Payment Scheme\"\u003eBPS\u003c/abbr\u003e and no longer meets the land eligibility criteria.  For example, if a stretch of river bank had been washed away and the boundary of the field has subsequently moved, then the area washed away would be a permanent change. In these circumstances, farmers should write to RPA for force majeure within 15 working days of being in a position to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny farmers who have Cover Crops counting towards their \u003cabbr title=\"Ecological Focus Area\"\u003eEFA\u003c/abbr\u003e requirement that have been destroyed by the flooding should also request force majeure within 15 working days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers don’t need to notify RPA where field boundaries have been destroyed if the intention is to re-instate the boundary. If there has been a permanent change to the boundary, then this will need to be reported to the RPA using an RLE 1 form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"farming-recovery-fund\"\u003eFarming Recovery Fund\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFarmers whose businesses have been affected by flooding will be able to apply for support grants of up to £20,000 to help restore damaged agricultural land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-the-farming-recovery-fund-frf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eapplication form and guidance\u003c/a\u003e is now available.

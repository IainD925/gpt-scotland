Criminal offences (counterfeiting and piracy)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInfringement of trade marks and copyrights can be criminal offences, as well as being actionable in civil law. A range of criminal provisions are set out in the relevant Acts, and other offences such as those under the Fraud Act 2006 may also be applied. These criminal offences are most often associated with organised crime groups who are dealing for profit in fake branded goods or pirated products. However,  these offences can also occur in legitimate business, for example if an employee uses the workplace to produce and/or sell quantities of fake DVDs or branded goods to colleagues or outside the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-criminal-intellectual-property-ip-rights-infringement\"\u003e1.1.

Counterfeiting can be defined as the manufacture, importation, distribution and sale of products which falsely carry the trade mark of a genuine brand without permission and for gain or loss to another. Piracy, which includes copying, distribution, importation etc of infringing works, does not always require direct profits from sales - wider and indirect benefits may be enough along with inflicting financial loss onto the rights holder. For example possession of an infringing copy of a work protected by copyright in the course of your business may be a criminal offence under section 107 (1)(c) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all cases that fall within the criminal law provisions will be dealt with as criminal offences and in many cases business to business type disputes are tackled by the civil law.

If you win, their design may be cancelled (invalidated).

Trade mark infringement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you use an identical or similar trade mark for identical or similar goods and services to a registered trade mark - you may be infringing the registered mark if your use creates a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. This includes the case where because of the similarities between the marks the public are led to the mistaken belief that the trade marks, although different, identify the goods or services of one and the same trader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the registered mark has a significant reputation, infringement may also arise from the use of the same or a similar mark which, although not causing confusion, damages or takes unfair advantage of the reputation of the registered mark. This can occasionally arise from the use of the same or similar mark for goods or services which are dissimilar to those covered by the registration of the registered mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-about-unregistered-trade-marks\"\u003e9.1. What about unregistered trade marks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no available remedy for trade mark infringement if the earlier trade mark is unregistered. Some unregistered trade marks may be protected under Common Law and this is known as Passing off. However, whether or not they are protected will depend on the particular circumstances, in particular:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether, and to what extent, the owner of the unregistered trade mark was trading under the name at the date of commencement of the use of the later mark;\nWhether the two marks are sufficiently similar, having regard to their fields of trade, so as to be likely to confuse and deceive (whether or not intentionally) a substantial number of persons into thinking that the junior user’s goods and services are those of the senior user;\nThe extent of the damage that such confusion would cause to the goodwill in the senior user’s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"i-think-that-i-may-be-infringing-what-should-i-do\"\u003e9.2.

There may be a number of potential courses of action or defences open to you, but this will very much depend on the particular circumstances of your case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome traders who think they may be infringing an earlier trade mark choose to cease trading under the offending sign, others choose to approach the earlier trade mark owner and attempt to negotiate a way forward that suits both parties, which may include a co-existence agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you decide that you are not infringing, or you have a good defence, you may decide to stand your ground or even to sue the trade mark holder for making unjustified threats.

However you must be satisfied that the earlier trade mark that you own and the activities of the infringer justify this. This is because the law also protects traders from unjustifiable threats of trade mark infringement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be able to negotiate a settlement which suits both parties, which may involve a co-existence agreement. Another option is that you may be able to get a court order to force the infringer to cease trading and pay compensation for damages. However, infringement actions must be taken to the High Court or in Scotland, the Court of Session.

Copyright infringement can be dealt with in the civil courts such as the High Court (Chancery Division), the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court and certain county courts where there is also a Chancery District Registry.

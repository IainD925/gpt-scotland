The UK does not participate in all of these programmes, but there are 15 programmes that cover all or parts of the UK. Nine of these involve England, and these are overseen by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\"\u003eDLUHC\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the programmes work across borders projects must involve organisations from more than one member state; the best projects will have a wide coverage of different organisations from across the programme area, as well as a clear plan to spread the results of their project more widely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProjects are coordinated by a ‘lead partner’, who ensures that the project partnership functions effectively. Programmes employ staff to support the generation of good project ideas, and then to manage the projects chosen for delivery. Each programme has slightly different arrangements and requirements, which can be found below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"role-of-dluhc\"\u003eRole of \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\"\u003eDLUHC\u003c/abbr\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\"\u003eDLUHC\u003c/abbr\u003e acts for the UK by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einfluencing the shape of the programmes for achieving greater impact and effective use of  investment\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eparticipating in meetings that report on programme progress and make joint decisions (with other participating member states) about projects to be supported\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eliaising with and managing the programme contact points who advise and support potential UK applicants\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eensuring effective verification of expenditure claims of UK project partners to minimise any irregularities and more generally ensuring that expenditure is eligible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor any queries about the \u003cabbr title=\"European territorial cooperation\"\u003eETC\u003c/abbr\u003e programmes, please contact \u003ca href=\"mailto:ETCTeam@levellingup.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eETCTeam@levellingup.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"uk-priorities\"\u003eUK priorities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrevious rounds of these programmes have not done enough to demonstrate the real impact of the money they have spent, and some poor-quality projects have been selected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 2014 to 2020 programmes, we expect to see a much clearer link between the projects that are funded, and to wider economic growth policy.

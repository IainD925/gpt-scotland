During this time, anyone may provide us with comments or additional information about the application or the impact that it may have on the area. You can also ask the Forestry Commission for more information on specific tree felling proposals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost tree felling applications are for work on private land and you may need permission if you wish to enter the area.

Felling licences are normally granted with the condition that the land where the tree felling takes place is replanted with trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are exemptions to needing to apply for a felling licence, such as for trees in:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edomestic gardens\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echurchyards\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eorchards\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epublic open space or, for pruning or remedial tree works\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forestry Commission also consults local authorities and other organisations with statutory powers in relation to land use before deciding whether to approve applications for tree felling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forestry Commission will only grant a felling licence if the proposals for tree felling are consistent with good forestry practice as outlined in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Forestry Standard.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind out more about \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-felling-licence-when-you-need-to-apply\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehow to apply for a tree felling licence.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an offence to fell trees without a licence or other permission, unless it’s covered by an exemption.

The name and address of the applicant will not be shown. If you submit comments about an application, we’ll consider them as part of our application review process, and may also discuss them with the applicant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eFind your \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/access-and-opening\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eForestry Commission local area office and administrative hub contact details including, address, telephone number and email address.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-we-do-with-your-comments\"\u003eWhat we do with your comments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we receive comments or other information about the application, we may discuss these with the applicant and we may ask them to change the tree felling proposals to take these comments into account. In most cases where this happens, reasonable changes can be made and a satisfactory solution reached. Conversely, we may decide that in the light of the information we have received, the application should be refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we’ve made our decision, we publish details of the final approved felling licence on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-the-public-registers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRegister of Woodland Planting and Tree Felling.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"tree-preservation-orders\"\u003eTree Preservation Orders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal planning authorities (LPAs) deal with planning matters relating to trees and hedges, and with \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eTree Preservation Orders (TPOs)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if protected trees are to be felled and would normally require a felling licence, then the land owner must apply to the Forestry Commission for a felling licence.

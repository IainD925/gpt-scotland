This is an increase in weighted prevalence of over 2-fold from round 18, where the figure stood at 2.88%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeighted prevalence was very high and increased between rounds 18 and 19 in all age brackets. Prevalence was highest in 5 to 11-year olds at 8.81%, nearly double the rate reported in the same age bracket in round 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a possible decrease in prevalence within round 19 in those aged 5 to 17 and a possible plateauing prevalence in those aged 18 to 35 and those aged 35 to 54, but a within-round increasing trend in those aged 55 and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the analyses showed a within-round reproductive number (R) of 1.10 in those aged 18 to 34 years, 1.04 in those aged 35 to 54 years and 1.12 in those aged 55 and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA total of 3,383 viral lineages were determined from the 4,038 positive samples up to 22 March; 89.7% (3,035) of these lineages corresponded to BA.2 or its sub-lineages, and 10.2% (346) to BA.1 and its sub-lineages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just one case of the AY.4 Delta sub-lineage detected and one case of BA.3, while there was additional detection of both the XE and XL recombinants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExponential models estimated a daily growth advantage for BA.2 of 0.11 compared to all other Omicron sub-lineages. These models estimate that as of 22 March 2022 the proportion of BA.2 in all recorded infections across the country was 94.7%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeighted prevalence in round 19 was higher in all regions of the country compared to round 18, ranging from 5.28% in the West Midlands to 8.13% in the South West. The recorded prevalence in the next highest region, the East of England, was 7.17%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt a lower-tier local authority level, of the 10 highest smoothed estimates of prevalence based on a nearest neighbour method, 7 were in the South West – Plymouth, Cornwall, South Hams, Torridge, Torbay, West Devon and Exeter. The other 3 highest – Braintree, Colchester and Maldon – were in the East of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rate of prevalence among those who had been in contact with a positive case stood at 17.8% compared to 4.00% in those without such contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmong those who tested positive and reported on symptoms, 26.7% reported no symptoms in round 19 compared to 28.6% in round 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 109,000 volunteers in England took part in the study to examine the levels of COVID-19 in the general population between 8 March and 31 March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n",

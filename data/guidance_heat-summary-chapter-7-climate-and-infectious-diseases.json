One reason for this is routine vaccination programmes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe chapter analyses evidence for future impacts of climate change on several types of virus. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the impact of climate change in the UK, to the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAstrovirus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSapovirus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is currently mixed evidence regarding the impact of climate change in the UK, to the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNorovirus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRespiratory syncytial virus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRotavirus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch suggests that other factors, aside from climate change, will have a greater influence on virus burden and incidence, for the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAdenovirus\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eInfluenza\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture is also complicated across bacteria.

Similarly, evidence suggests that Salmonellosis will result in more cases of salmonella – however this is being combatted by improvements in food hygiene and reducing the pathogen levels in major food groups in the UK. The Vibrosis bacteria group, which includes the bacteria that causes cholera, may become more prevalent as coastal flooding expands areas of coastal brackish environments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParasitic diseases such as Cyclosporiasis are linked to travel from outside the UK and there is little evidence about how increases in outbreaks in other countries could impact UK cases. Studies have shown that Cryptosporidiosis cases can increase with temperature and more extreme winter rainfall. Finally, Giardiasis could have a longer peak with warmer summer temperatures but more UK-specific research is needed here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClimate impacts ecological factors, such as the environment in which infectious agents live and multiply. If an organism’s biology is impacted by climatic and ecological factors, its ranges and seasonality may be affected. Warmer temperatures can alter the geographical distribution of infectious diseases and extend the transmission periods of some diseases. A changing climate also has the ability to change modes of disease transmission (through altering vector species like rodents), impact human behaviour (through changes in food preparation habits during warmer weather) and additionally lead to the emergence of new pathogen species.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is emerging evidence to suggest that antimicrobial resistance might be influenced by climate change. Warmer temperatures could speed up bacterial growth and expand their geographical ranges. This makes the appearance of resistant bacteria more likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

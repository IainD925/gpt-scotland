Generally common parts will include the structural and external elements of a building, as well as shared areas (e.g. external walls, roof, stairs and lifts).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe commonhold association will have at least two directors - these can be unit owners like you, or external professionals can be employed.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe directors of the commonhold association decide how much money unit owners will need to contribute to cover the costs of repairing and maintaining the commonhold.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe directors of the commonhold association can also decide to manage the building themselves or appoint a managing agent to manage the building on their behalf.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAs a unit owner you have the opportunity to participate in the commonhold association and to vote on decisions like who to appoint as a director and whether to make building improvements, such as vehicle charging points, for example.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLike other companies, the commonhold association must have “articles of association” which govern how it operates.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-rights-and-responsibilities-do-i-have-in-a-commonhold\"\u003eWhat rights and responsibilities do I have in a commonhold?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEach commonhold has a ‘rulebook’ called the Commonhold Community Statement, or CCS.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CCS sets out the rights and obligations of the unit owner. The main rights and obligations are standardised and will be the same in every commonhold.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe CCS can also be tailored by the commonhold association to include bespoke ‘local rules’. There is some flexibility to change these rules and update them over time to respond to changing needs, standards or advances in technology.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-are-disputes-resolved-under-commonhold\"\u003eHow are disputes resolved under commonhold?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhen disputes arise between unit owners, or between a unit owner and the commonhold association, or vice versa, parties must follow the commonhold dispute resolution procedure for commonhold (set out in the CCS) before taking legal action.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe procedure is designed to encourage affected parties to resolve disputes through early communication and without the need to go to court.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eBut there are some circumstances, for example in an emergency, or where a unit owner has failed to make a due payment, where the dispute procedure does not need to be used.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-i-convert-my-leasehold-building-to-commonhold\"\u003eCan I convert my leasehold building to commonhold?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIf you own a leasehold property in a shared building, it may be possible for you and the other leaseholders in the building to convert the building to commonhold.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eConversion requires the unanimous consent of the freeholder, all other leaseholders in the building and their lenders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-the-government-doing-to-support-commonhold\"\u003eWhat is the government doing to support commonhold?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe government wants to see widespread take-up of commonhold.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSince its introduction in 2002 however, take up of commonhold has been low.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA key reason has been that commonhold has had to compete with the more established leasehold model which can also generate additional income streams for developers or investors, such as through ground rents.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/leasehold-reform-ground-rent-act-2022\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLeasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act\u003c/a\u003e is restricting use of ground rents in future leasehold buildings and will help level the playing field for commonhold.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThere are also some limitations in the current legal design of commonhold which can limit its use in some settings. The government asked the Law Commission to recommend reforms to the commonhold legislation to reinvigorate commonhold as a workable alternative to leasehold, for both existing and new homes. The Law Commission published its report in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/commonhold/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eJuly 2020\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe government is currently considering these recommendations and will respond in due course.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn May 2021, the government established the Commonhold Council - a partnership of leasehold groups, industry and government that will prepare homeowners and the market for the widespread take-up of commonhold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"related-content\"\u003eRelated content:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/commonhold-council\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCommonhold Council\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLeasehold property\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flat-management-and-right-to-manage-rtm-companies/about-flat-management-companies-rtm-companies-and-commonhold-associations\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFlat management and right to manage (RTM) companies\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/15/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCommonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lease-advice.org/advice-guide/commonhold/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLeasehold Advisory Service: Commonhold guide\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

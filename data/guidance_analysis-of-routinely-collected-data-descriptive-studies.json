This data may be used for the running of the product or service. It can also be analysed as a form of evaluation. When carrying out an evaluation, you will usually have a specific question driving your analysis of the data. The question will usually be about the effect or impact on users. You may do this as a one-off, or you could develop a regular process of data analysis for evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat data is collected depends on how the product has been designed. This means the available data may not answer the most important evaluation questions. When designing the product, or an update, try to plan for what data would help with evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can analyse usage data to understand how people are using the product. For example, you could look at:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etotal number of downloads\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enumber of users disengaging from the product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhich features of the product get used\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe product may also collect data on the user, either passively (for example, data from motion sensors on physical activity) or actively (for example, asking the user to record their drinking behaviour).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysing the data can show whether the product is popular with users. It can also show whether the product is producing the change it is intended to. However, there are limitations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusually the data available from the user is self-reported, which can be biased\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edata is only available from users; it does not tell you what has happened to non-users\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can look at data collected from normal use of the product. This is a type of audit or observational study. You can also use this data in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/before-and-after-study-comparative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ebefore-and-after studies\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/randomised-controlled-trial-comparative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003erandomised controlled trials\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be valuable to regularly examine data from an app using methods like statistical process control (\u003cabbr title=\"statistical process control\"\u003eSPC\u003c/abbr\u003e). \u003cabbr title=\"statistical process control\"\u003eSPC\u003c/abbr\u003e and similar methods, like Six Sigma, can be used to monitor and control processes and see when there are deviations from normal conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-smokefree28\"\u003eExample: SmokeFree28\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Ubhi and others (2015): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.jmir.org/2015/1/e17/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eA Mobile App to Aid Smoking Cessation: Preliminary Evaluation of SmokeFree28\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team evaluated a smoking cessation app called SmokeFree28. They analysed data from downloads over a year’s period. The evaluation used a benchmark. They compared how many users successfully quit smoking to data from a large sample of smokers trying to quit in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey asked app users some background questions (age category, gender, occupational group, number of cigarettes smoked per day, time since previous quit attempt, weekly expenditure on cigarettes, choice of medication option). Users could not be identified from this data. The study got approval from a university ethics committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe study found that 19% of users managed to stop smoking, which they defined as being abstinent for at least 28 days. The report notes that they are relying on users’ self-report and that this is not as reliable as a biochemical measure of abstinence. People who stopped using the app didn’t meet the criteria for being abstinent and so were considered not to have stopped, even though some of them might have. This is an example of making a conservative assumption with missing data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe percentage of users who managed to stop smoking was higher than the 15% benchmark figure. However, the evaluation noted that app users were unlike the general population of people trying to give up smoking. App users smoked more, were younger, more often women, and more often in a non-manual rather than manual job.\nThe evaluation showed correlations between background and users who were most successful at giving up smoking. Users who were older, in non-manual jobs or using smoking cessation medication were more likely to quit. More use of the app was also associated with greater success at quitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe evaluation also reported usage of the app, for example, the average number of logins (8.5) and which groups of people used the app more. For example, people who previously attempted to quit over a year ago used the app more than those who had not previously tried to quit smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team planned to move on to a comparative study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNaughton and others (2016): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27637405/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eA Context-Sensing Mobile Phone App (Q Sense) for Smoking Cessation: A Mixed-Methods Study\u003c/a\u003e.

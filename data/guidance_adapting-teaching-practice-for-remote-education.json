The Department for Education has been working with schools to develop this series, based on the current experiences and practices of teachers and school leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith so many options available to support remote education, one of the most important decisions schools are making is to keep it simple, making sure pupils, parents, carers and teachers know what is being asked of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact approaches adopted by each school will vary depending on the needs of its pupils and school context. There is no single right answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following considerations may help in adapting practices to best meet the needs of pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"designing-activities-that-are-accessible-for-pupils\"\u003eDesigning activities that are accessible for pupils\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all pupils’ home environments will support their education. And some may not have access to a device or have an internet connection at home which allows them to learn online, or join in at scheduled lesson times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome schools have been able to identify and provide these pupils with devices, but this is not always possible. To help address this issue, schools with specific groups of disadvantaged pupils can get technology support for children and schools during coronavirus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEducational activities could also be created in a range of formats, so that they are accessible to all, reducing the risk of pupils being left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePupils are more likely to have access to mobile phones than laptops or computers, so using formats (like PDFs) that can be viewed on mobile devices can improve access to  resources. Other schools have identified teaching resources that can be easily printed and posted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith children spending more time online, it’s important that schools and colleges are considering online safety as they plan and design their teaching activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The key is to make sure that pupils have the means to do what you’re asking them to do”, said Steve Rollett at the Association of School and College Leaders. “This challenge might also be met by ensuring that some learning activities can be done without online access.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ensuring-remote-education-is-accessible-offline\"\u003eEnsuring remote education is accessible offline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany schools have created hard copies of work for pupils who are unable to access online learning. These packs have then either been dropped off at children’s homes, or made available for collection at school or local supermarkets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePupils using hard copies have sometimes been asked to submit work by taking photos on their phones and texting or emailing them to their teachers. In some primary schools, parents are doing this on behalf of their younger children. Teachers are then able to make phone calls home to provide formative feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLaurie Carter of Cooper’s Lane Primary school shared their approach. “Feedback for these unconnected pupils has been predominantly through phone calls,” she said. “In most cases even those without laptops and broadband have enough mobile data to send occasional emails using a smartphone. So all parents have their teacher’s email address and are being encouraged to send in photos of their children’s work and what they have been doing at home so that teachers can respond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Teachers are also including these photos in a weekly video to showcase the children’s work, which is being put on the Google Classroom once a week,” she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"getting-technology-support\"\u003eGetting technology support\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities, academy trusts and schools may be able to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eget technology support for children and schools during coronavirus\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ensuring-remote-education-practices-are-inclusive\"\u003eEnsuring remote education practices are inclusive\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEffective communication channels are important to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (\u003cabbr title=\"special educational needs and disabilities\"\u003eSEND\u003c/abbr\u003e). Many schools use video calls, instant messaging and weekly phone calls to support pupils with their learning needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany educational platforms that are commonly used include a wide range of free accessibility features. For example, voice-to-text and text-to-speech conversion, or different viewing formats to support pupils with dyslexia and other special educational needs. It may be useful for teachers to research these features when planning and designing their teaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApproaches and support will need to be tailored to individual needs to prevent children falling further behind. This is particularly important for vulnerable children who might have further barriers to learning in their home environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Our \u003cabbr title=\"special educational needs and disabilities\"\u003eSEND\u003c/abbr\u003e pupils are getting twice-weekly phone calls from our Special Educational Needs Coordinator (\u003cabbr title=\"Special Educational Needs Coordinator\"\u003eSENCO\u003c/abbr\u003e) to support their learning,” shared Janine Ashman of St Peter’s Church of England Primary School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeekly meetings are at the core of inclusive practices at HISP Research School at Thornden. “The \u003cabbr title=\"special educational needs and disabilities\"\u003eSEND\u003c/abbr\u003e department have had weekly online team meetings to discuss the pupils with an education, health and care (\u003cabbr title=\"education, health and care\"\u003eEHC\u003c/abbr\u003e) plan,” said Steve Smith. “Each pupil has been allocated a Learning Support Assistant (\u003cabbr title=\"Learning Support Assistant\"\u003eLSA\u003c/abbr\u003e) link to contact the pupil and their parents or carers on a weekly basis to check in and to offer support. LSAs continue to run booster lessons with targeted groups of pupils via Microsoft Teams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan Bishop of Cornerstone Academy Trust advises “thinking about \u003cabbr title=\"special educational needs and disabilities\"\u003eSEND\u003c/abbr\u003e tools and support required – screen readers and accessibility tools are important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"using-existing-technology\"\u003eUsing existing technology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany schools have preferred to use technology already familiar to staff, pupils and parents, rather than introducing new technology. This has made the process of moving to remote education practices smoother.\nLouis Everett of West London Free School strongly advised “using existing online platforms, Show My Homework in our case, as these are familiar to pupils and parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJanine Ashman of St Peter’s Church of England Primary School said that they “have tried to ensure we are using remote teaching models pupils are already familiar with. For example, accessing work from our website or platforms such as YouTube that they will use on a regular basis. We have not introduced new systems now, as we think this could be stressful for staff and families.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"providing-training\"\u003eProviding training\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all teachers, parents and pupils will feel confident using technology to support remote education. \nTo help all teachers and pupils make best use of technology and tools, identify any who may need additional help and think about how to address gaps in their capability and increase their confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome schools have provided training or peer-to-peer support to teachers and pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Dove of the National Organisation of Pupil Referral Units and Alternative Provision (\u003cabbr title=\"Pupil Referral Units and Alternative Provision\"\u003ePRUsAP\u003c/abbr\u003e), as well as Phoenix Education Consultancy, shared her experience. She noted that teachers are currently being trained to provide learning through Microsoft Teams. “Pupils and staff have been allocated emails and training is in place,” she said. “We’re very proud of the rate at which this has happened but also recognise that this was a gap in provision when the lockdown began.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"keeping-a-focus-on-effective-teaching-practice\"\u003eKeeping a focus on effective teaching practice\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTeachers will have a good understanding of what effective teaching practice looks like in a classroom setting, but these same practices will often be more difficult to maintain when teaching remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome teaching practices may need additional planning to work well. This might include providing pupils with different ways of explaining concepts or identifying any likely misconceptions in advance. Some schools have found that doing these things helps pupils manage if they get stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“In principle, the fundamentals of teaching a remote lesson are the same as teaching a classroom lesson,” explained Steve Smith of HISP Research School at Thornden. “Revisiting prior learning, chunking up new knowledge, teacher explanations or modelling, scaffolding, pupil practice, learning checks, to name a few.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“However, a normal classroom lesson would be dialogue-rich with lots of questioning and the teacher getting feedback all of the time,” he continued. “This amount of feedback isn’t as readily available in an online lesson, therefore teacher explanations need to be planned more thoroughly. Many teachers are finding that they have initially been too ambitious about what can be achieved in a remote lesson compared to a normal classroom lesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"feedback-and-assessment\"\u003eFeedback and assessment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSchools are considering what monitoring of pupil progress is realistic while they remain closed to most pupils, and the steps needed when schools start to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome schools have put school-wide approaches in place to monitor work completion. Teachers are also building formative assessment and feedback into their teaching approach through a mixture of quizzes, digital tools and modelling of good answers. These will help teachers understand how pupils are achieving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Feeding back remotely increased workload and had the potential to be done poorly…,” noted Louis Everett of West London Free School. “We prioritised work-savvy methods to improve the immediacy and frequency of feedback. We also dissuaded teachers from using ‘mark-scheme language’ or giving pupils mark-schemes to self-assess, so pupils still had teacher input on how to improve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"allowing-variation-across-your-school\"\u003eAllowing variation across your school\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExpectations about remote education practice will vary according to a school’s context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn primary schools, for example, pupils will need more support from parents, and extended periods of screen time for learning may not be engaging without a mix of other activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn secondary schools, older pupils may be able to learn more independently, while younger year groups continue to need support. The approach to teaching and level of contact teachers have with pupils may also need to be different across subject areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSchools may want to consider where different approaches are appropriate, and how this can be achieved while also giving pupils, parents and carers, clear and simple ways to access information on what they need to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"case-studies\"\u003eCase studies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead the following case studies from schools sharing their experience on how they have adapted to remote education:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/adaptive-teaching-design\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eadaptive teaching design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/using-a-virtual-learning-environment\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eusing a virtual learning environment\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/using-digital-teaching-tools\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eusing digital teaching tools\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/using-video-lessons\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eusing video lessons\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/providing-physical-work-packs-for-pupils-with-limited-or-no-internet-connection\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eproviding physical work packs for pupils with limited or no internet connection\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/a-mixed-approach-to-remote-education-at-a-primary-school\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ea mixed approach to remote education at a primary school\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/adapting-teaching-practice-for-remote-education-at-a-special-needs-secondary-school\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eadapting teaching practice for remote education at a special needs secondary school\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

Freight forwarders specialise in moving cargo. They also arrange customs clearance of goods, maintain all documentation, oversee cargo packing and will at times deal with the movement of dangerous goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide gives you information on the business of freight forwarding and identifies the key issues surrounding the moving of goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"customs-and-frontier-controls\"\u003eCustoms and frontier controls\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOrganisations such as HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs (\u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Rural Payments Agency have an interest in UK frontier or border controls. Many products crossing the UK frontier will be subject to some types of licensing and control - some products may be prohibited from entering at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of a freight forwarder’s main functions is to arrange customs clearance of goods crossing the frontier. Freight forwarders can do this themselves, or subcontract it to a company that specialises in customs broking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to provide customs services, the freight forwarder needs to have sufficient funds available to handle the bonds and guarantees required for duty and taxes payments. He or she also needs specific software that can communicate with the \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e central computer. Nearly all the \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e functions are now electronic, and special software for reporting and payments is necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-uk-trade-tariff\"\u003eThe UK Trade Tariff\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ‘Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom’ sets out the duties and measures affecting the import, export, and transit of goods to and from the UK and consolidates UK-specific data with the European Union \u003cabbr title=\"Integrated Tariff of the European Communities\"\u003eTARIC\u003c/abbr\u003e data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFind commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing our online \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Trade Tariff tool\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"international-trade-documentation-for-freight-forwarders\"\u003eInternational trade documentation for freight forwarders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDocumentation is a requirement in international trade and for moving goods. Well-ordered and accurate documents are essential for a freight forwarder and are required for a successful export order and receipt of payment for delivery. Freight forwarders need to know exactly what document is required and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen preparing to move goods, the freight forwarder must first receive clear instructions from the importer or exporter - ideally well in advance of the goods being moved. These should be in writing and can be done via email or fax. However, the shipper will often hand the paperwork over to the driver collecting the goods, which is standard practice for air freight. If any instructions are taken over the telephone, they should then be confirmed to the customer in writing to avoid any later problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther documents that are provided by the importer or exporter include invoices, packing lists and licences. Responsibility for hazardous goods declarations also lies with the shipper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach mode of transport will have its own document of carriage, such as the:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eair waybill - for air freight\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebill of lading - for sea freight\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCMR consignment note - for road freight\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe issuer of these documents may differ, but freight forwarders need to be familiar with them and their individual procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreight forwarders should also understand documents that relate to customs clearance at import and export.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"packing-goods-for-export-and-deciding-on-packing-materials-to-be-used\"\u003ePacking goods for export and deciding on packing materials to be used\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePacking goods for export requires specialist knowledge and is a service that a freight forwarder can offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen deciding on packing for a piece of cargo, the freight forwarder needs to ensure that the goods are received in the same condition as when they left the consigner, warehouse or factory. They must also bear in mind the ease of handling, risks in transit and delivery and protection from unauthorised access and the environment. Customers should be advised - as early as possible - to consider the fragility of the goods and plan the packing for any specific risks in transit. Over-packing can add unnecessary costs that might incur extra costs on the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWood used for packing is subject to international legislation. Many countries require phytosanitary - plant health - certifications to show that the wood has been fumigated. Countries such as China, New Zealand and Australia have very strict controls over the use of packing materials. Waste wood used in containers for securing cargo is also subject to the same regulations. Not being aware of this could prove costly if the container has to be returned to the port of origin for re-packing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreight forwarders also need to be aware of legislation over the safe disposal of the materials used for packing goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"freight-forwarders-regulations-for-moving-dangerous-goods\"\u003eFreight forwarders’ regulations for moving dangerous goods\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransporting dangerous goods is covered by national and international legislation. A freight forwarder might not come into direct contact with the goods, even though they will be passing on the documents and instructions to those who are. The documents must be prepared accordingly and the goods must be packed appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you decide not to handle consignments of dangerous goods, you need to recognise them if they are presented for carriage. There are many products that have a danger classification and it’s not always possible to know this from the name of the product.

However, if the freight forwarder is loading these items into containers or onto pallets, they should be aware of dangerous goods and each aspect surrounding their movement. The British International Freight Association (\u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e) runs specialist training courses on dangerous goods. \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bifa.org/content/Training.aspx#20GLink\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eView a list of \u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e courses\u003c/a\u003e on dangerous goods on the \u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach mode of transport has its own compliance requirements regulations.

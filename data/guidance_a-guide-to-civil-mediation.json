Unlike in court, where a judge makes the decisions, in mediation you are able to decide how you want to resolve the dispute and don’t have to accept an outcome you are not happy with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation is usually much quicker and much less expensive than going to court, so it can be a more efficient way of resolving disagreements that allows everyone to move on from the problem sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation provides a safe and supportive environment. The mediator will listen to all views, talking to you privately, and sometimes together with the other party, to help guide you through the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation is confidential. Where disputes are resolved through the court, it is potentially a very public process. However, when disputes are settled out of court through mediation, it is private between you and the other party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation can help preserve your relationships. Settling a dispute through an adversarial court battle can put added pressure on the relationship between both parties. However, mediation helps you focus on communicating effectively with each other to find solutions that work for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-is-the-best-time-to-mediate\"\u003eWhen is the best time to mediate? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation can take place at any time before your case reaches a hearing or trial at court, and the best time will often depend on your individual case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, it is best to try mediation as soon as you can. This will help reduce the amount of time and money spent on the dispute and open a dialogue with the other party before they become too fixed in their position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have already started a court claim and wish to mediate, the court can pause your case to enable you to do so. The judge will not be told what is discussed or offered at mediation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"is-offering-tomediate-a-sign-of-weakness\"\u003eIs offering to mediate a sign of weakness? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It can be empowering to make the first move and you are always in control at mediation. You choose what information can be discussed with the other side, and you choose whether to settle and on what terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-much-does-mediation-cost\"\u003eHow much does mediation cost?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will depend on the type of mediation and the complexity of the dispute. You should ask your mediation provider what their costs are in advance of the mediation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your dispute is regarding a money claim under £10,000, you may be able to use the Government’s free \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/small-claims-mediation-service\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSmall Claims Mediation Service\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a landlord or tenant involved in a housing possession case, you may be able to use the Government’s free \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rental-mediation-service\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRental Mediation Service\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your dispute is under £50,000 in value, the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://civilmediation.org/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCivil Mediation Council\u003c/a\u003e hosts a \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://civilmediation.org/fixed-fee-scheme/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFixed Fee Mediation Scheme\u003c/a\u003e  which allows parties to employ a mediator at reasonable rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-pays-for-mediation\"\u003eWho pays for mediation?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will depend upon the type of dispute, but typically both sides pay an equal share of the fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-long-does-mediation-take\"\u003eHow long does mediation take?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth sides may come to an agreement in just a couple of hours or it might take more than one session over a longer period. However, the majority of civil mediations are concluded in a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-during-mediation\"\u003eWhat happens during mediation?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis can vary depending on the type of mediation but in general the mediator will talk to both sides separately to hear their version of events, and, if agreed, may then bring all the participants together to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey are there to assist with the negotiation so both sides can hopefully reach a settlement they agree on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediators are experts in communication and understand the strong emotions that can be generated when we are in dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-i-have-to-be-in-the-same-room-as-the-person-i-am-in-mediation-with\"\u003eDo I have to be in the same room as the person I am in mediation with?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn mediation, you can still work to find an agreement without being in the same room or space with the other person - you don’t have to spend time with the person you are in mediation with if you choose not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour mediator can help you find a way to resolve your disagreements without being in direct contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediation online is also possible, giving participants greater space and the option of mediating from your own home or other private space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-the-mediator-provide-advice\"\u003eCan the mediator provide advice? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo. The mediator will help you consider different options to resolve the dispute, but they don’t give advice. Their role is to facilitate a conversation between you and the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they can assist you with communication and managing emotions, helping you to make your points calmly and clearly, and to listen to the other side without interrupting or getting angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mediator will support you if you are finding the process stressful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"is-mediation-appropriate-for-everyone\"\u003eIs mediation appropriate for everyone?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor some users who are vulnerable or are in a Domestic Abuse situation with the other person, mediation would not be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"does-the-mediator-decide-what-happens\"\u003eDoes the mediator decide what happens? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mediator helps to keep things moving forward so both sides feel progress is being made, but the mediator doesn’t decide on the outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMediators are skilled at helping parties to see a way through the dispute, but do not impose solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is for you and the other side to agree on how you are going to settle the dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-i-have-to-attend-mediation-on-my-own\"\u003eDo I have to attend mediation on my own?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to you can attend mediation on your own or you can bring a partner, family members or friends with you for support. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on the type of dispute you may also want to have a legal representative, known as a mediation advocate, with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mediator will assist in getting everyone’s agreement as to who will be attending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"is-mediation-confidential\"\u003eIs mediation confidential? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes.

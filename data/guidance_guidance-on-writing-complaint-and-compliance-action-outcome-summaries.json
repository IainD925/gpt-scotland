We do this when we have looked into a concern or a notification. It applies to those providers on the Early Years Register. We publish these outcome summaries on the same page as the provider’s reports on our website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"principles-for-publishing-an-outcome-summary\"\u003ePrinciples for publishing an outcome summary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we look into a concern or notification, we will always publish an outcome summary if we or the provider have taken action to meet requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we take different enforcement action, we will update the existing outcome summary, for example if we move from a welfare requirements notice to cancellation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a child has died in the setting, we will refer to the death in the outcome summary unless the parents have indicated that they do not wish this to happen. We will only include this information if the action that we or the provider took relates to the child’s death. We do not publish details of historical deaths at the setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we take enforcement action that is subject to objection and/or appeal, we will still publish an outcome summary. We will make it clear that the provider has the right to challenge our decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a case relates solely to the suitability of a registered person and the registered person is responsible for more than one setting, for example a chain of nurseries, we open a regulatory case for each setting registered to that provider. This allows us to publish an outcome summary for each registered setting. This only applies when the registered person is the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will not publish an outcome summary when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe carry out an inspection, including a priority inspection, a reinspection or an inspection at the end of other regulatory action\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe suspend a provider’s registration, because suspension is not an enforcement action and we use other ways to let parents and prospective parents know about the suspension; however, an outcome summary may have details of a suspension if we have also taken other enforcement action\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe provider is only on the Childcare Register, because if we follow up any concerns we will always do this through an inspection\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we inspect a provider, the inspection report will cover any breaches of requirements that we find and details of any action taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"complaints-about-the-publication-of-outcome-summaries\"\u003eComplaints about the publication of outcome summaries\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a provider makes a complaint or raises a concern about the publication of an outcome summary, or the details included in the outcome summary, we will follow our normal \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complaints-about-ofsted\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecomplaints procedure\u003c/a\u003e. In these cases, we will not delay publication of the outcome summary if some action is still in progress. This is because we think that it is important for parents and carers to have up-to-date information. If the outcome of our work changes once we have completed it, we will publish an amended outcome summary. Published outcome summaries remain on our website for 5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"recording-outcome-summaries\"\u003eRecording outcome summaries\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen updating the regulatory case on our system, the inspector must click the ‘create outcome summary’ button within the case to start the process. If an inspector wants to update the outcome summary, they should edit the event that has already been created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe inspector should specify the outcome of the case and note the reason for this decision. Inspectors should then complete the outcome summary box using the principles below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the outcome summary box is complete, inspectors should specify whether this is a complaint or compliance publication type and choose whether this should be published or not. Outcome summaries can be saved and published at a later date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the outcome summary is ready for publication, inspectors should add the current date to the outcome summary when prompted, which will publish or re-publish the information automatically.

If this is the case, once the Tribunal or court has made its decision, we will update the outcome summary and republish it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"objections-and-appeals\"\u003eObjections and appeals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf our enforcement action is subject to an objection to Ofsted or an appeal to the Tribunal, the outcome summary should include the action we are taking, but also state that the provider has objected to our decision or appealed to the Tribunal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"content-of-the-outcome-summary\"\u003eContent of the outcome summary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe outcome summary must include a link to the legal requirements that a provider must meet, and the date we received the information. The summary must also include brief details about the action that we or the provider needed to take as a result of the concern.

If we find that a provider is not meeting the requirements, we can take action to ensure they put matters right. On XXXXX, we received concerns that this provider was not meeting requirements relating to XXXX (EYFS requirement heading). We have served a welfare requirements notice. This is a legal notice that requires the provider to take the actions below within the timescales set out. The provider will be able to give parents further information about this.

The provider objected to us taking this step. Having heard the provider’s reasons for objecting to this step, we have decided not to proceed with cancellation.

The regulations set out a procedure for identifying those projects which should be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment, and for assessing, consulting and coming to a decision on those projects which are likely to have significant environmental effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe aim of Environmental Impact Assessment is also to ensure that the public are given early and effective opportunities to participate in the decision making procedures.

Local planning authorities and developers should carefully consider if a project should be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment.

We, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), administer the Scheme and decide if applicants are eligible and assess the appropriate value of any award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rules of the Scheme and the value of the payments awarded are set by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament. To qualify for an award, an injury must be described in the tariff of injuries at Annex E of the Scheme. The CICA must pay an award in line with these prescribed amounts, based on the severity of the injuries and the impact on you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise that no amount of compensation can ever make up for the harm and suffering caused to victims by violent crime. Injury awards are intended to be an acknowledgement of harm and an important gesture of public sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-payments-are-available-from-the-scheme\"\u003eWhat payments are available from the Scheme?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can consider claims for the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003emental or physical injury following a crime of violence;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003esexual or physical abuse;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eloss of earnings - where you have no or limited capacity to work as the direct result of a criminal injury;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003especial expenses payments - these cover certain costs you may have incurred as a direct result of an incident. You can only ask us to consider special expenses if your injuries mean you have been unable to work or have been incapacitated to a similar extent for more than 28 weeks;\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea fatality caused by a crime of violence including bereavement payments, payments for loss of parental services and financial dependency; and funeral payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo qualify for an award, an injury must be described in the tariff of injuries at Annex E of the Scheme. Not all claims for compensation will be successful; you must be eligible under the rules of the Scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"time-limits-for-applying\"\u003eTime limits for applying\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must apply as soon as it is reasonably practicable for you to do so. If you were an adult at the time of the incident, this should normally not be later than two years after it occurred. We can only extend this time limit where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edue to exceptional circumstances an application could not have been made earlier; and\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe evidence provided in support of the application means that it can be determined without further extensive enquiries by a claims officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications should be made without delay and victims should not wait until the conclusion of criminal proceedings. The Scheme does not require an offender to have been convicted and all compensation decisions are made on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/53/section/3\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘balance of probabilities’\u003c/a\u003e, based on the available evidence. This is different from a criminal court which decides on the basis of ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. We do not need to wait for the outcome of a criminal trial if there is already enough information to make a decision on your case, so you should never make that a reason for delaying your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you wish us to consider your application more than two years from the date of the incident you will need to provide us with evidence that shows why this application could not have been made earlier. You must also be able to provide supporting evidence for your claim that means that the claims officer can make a decision without further extensive enquiries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"time-limit-for-applicants-under-18-years-of-age-on-the-date-of-the-incident\"\u003eTime limit for applicants under 18 years of age on the date of the incident\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial provision is made in the Scheme if you were under 18 at the time of the incident, although you should still apply as soon as you can.

The deadline to apply was 13 June 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have discretion to consider applications beyond this deadline if there are exceptional circumstances which mean you could not have applied earlier, and the evidence supplied in support of your application means that it can be determined without the need for further extensive enquiries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility\"\u003eEligibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can compensate victims of violent crime, or people whose loved ones have died as a result of a crime of violence.

However, we will only make a payment if we are satisfied that you were taking an exceptional risk and that risk was justified in all the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA risk will not be considered exceptional if it was something that you might reasonably have been expected to do in the normal course of your work. In considering whether a risk is exceptional we will consider if the risk taken was unusual and was not something which you had been trained to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen considering if the risk was justified we will consider all the circumstances, including the seriousness of the situation, and whether there was an immediate threat to those involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"present-at-and-witnessed-an-incident-or-the-immediate-aftermath-of-an-incident\"\u003ePresent at and witnessed an incident or the immediate aftermath of an incident\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be eligible to make a claim for a mental injury if you witnessed, and were present at, an incident in which a loved one sustained a criminal injury as the result of a crime of violence. You may also be eligible if you were involved in the immediate aftermath of an incident in which a loved one sustained a criminal injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we say ‘immediate’ we are referring to the period of time immediately following the incident in which a loved one was injured and not where someone is later told about the incident either by the victim or another person. The requirement to have been present means that a person cannot make a claim where the incident was witnessed remotely, for example, through television or other media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are claiming a payment because you witnessed or were involved in the immediate aftermath of the injury of a loved one, you must have suffered a disabling mental injury to be eligible for an award. The Scheme defines a disabling mental injury as a mental injury which is disabling in that it has a substantial adverse effect on a person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities for the time specified (e.g., impaired work or school performance or effects on social relationships or sexual dysfunction). We will need medical evidence from a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist confirming that this is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"nationality-and-residency-criteria\"\u003eNationality and residency criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will only be eligible for a payment if you meet one of the residency, nationality or other requirements under paragraph 10.

If the crime for which you are seeking compensation has not been reported to the police, we cannot make a payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident must also be reported to the police as soon as is reasonably practicable. Where you have delayed reporting the incident to the police, we will ask you to explain why you delayed. We will always carefully consider the full circumstances of the case in determining whether you could have made the report earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn particular we will consider:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eyour age, capacity and well-being at the date of the incident and\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ewhether the effect of the incident was such that it could not reasonably have been reported earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you intend to claim compensation, it is essential that you report the incident to the police, even if you have reported it somewhere else such as your place of work or a doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"co-operating-in-bringing-an-assailant-to-justice\"\u003eCo-operating in bringing an assailant to justice\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not necessary for the person who injured you to be identified, or convicted, in order for you to be eligible for a payment. However, the Scheme requires that you co-operate as far as is reasonably practicable in bringing the assailant to justice.

If we agree it is possible to pay the full amount of your payment into such an account before you turn 18 then this could be an alternative to us holding on to your funds.

If we make an advance payment, we will need evidence, normally a receipt, proving that it has been used for the purposes intended. If we don’t get this evidence, we will not allow any further advances.

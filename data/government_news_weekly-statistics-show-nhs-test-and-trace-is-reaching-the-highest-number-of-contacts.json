This week’s statistics show we are making really good progress with more people responding to the service.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eNHS Test and Trace relies on everyone playing their part. We all need to get a test if we have symptoms, share details of our contacts if we test positive and self-isolate when asked to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eI want to thank each and every person for their individual efforts at keeping their friends, family and community safe. We know this isn’t easy and it is thanks to your hard work that we are able to stop the virus, prevent outbreaks and gradually get back to our normal lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStatistics released for the first time today show that 87.4% of tests in hospital settings are returned within 24 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe testing programme has been stood up at pace with current capacity for over 330,000 tests a day, which will grow to 500,000 a day by the end of October. Anyone in England of any age experiencing symptoms – a temperature, a new continuous cough or cold, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste – can get a test. It is the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities created in British history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the drive to towards the target of a 500,000-a-day UK testing capacity by the end of October, a new Lighthouse laboratory will open in Newport, which is expected to start operations at the end of August, and work is ongoing on plans to expand the UK’s laboratory capacity even further over the coming months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe continue to develop the system and we are currently working towards creating a dedicated team of contact tracers who will focus specifically on specific local areas of concern. They will work in partnership with local areas to quickly develop extra processes that are tailored to the needs of those communities. This includes dedicated call handlers, scripts tailored to the local outbreak context and lockdown measures, and specific reporting to provide a national and local comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall the data from the seventh week of operation (9 to 15 July) of NHS Test and Trace shows that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 9 and 15 July 2020:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e355,597 people were newly tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) under pillar 1 (testing in hospitals and outbreak locations) and pillar 2 (national swab testing) in England\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enearly half of people tested under pillar 2 received the result within 24 hours of taking a test.

Over the coming weeks, this data will be integrated with those from other parts of NHS Test and Trace to provide an end-to-end view of the service that follows the journey taken by people accessing NHS Test and Trace. This includes both the numbers of people engaged and the speed of the journey through the service, including data on test turnaround times.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePlease note that previous figures released on NHS Test and Trace have been revised. The figures presented are based on a data cut a number of days after the end of the reporting period, to give time for cases reported at the end of the 7-day period to have an outcome. Some cases may continue to be in progress after this period, and therefore data may need to be revised over time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",

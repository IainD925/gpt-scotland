It typically ranges between 2 weeks and 2 months. Data for the two most recent months is therefore incomplete and does not give an indication of final monthly volumes.

Previously when a transaction record was updated, the old transaction record was removed and a new one with a new Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) was added. This could cause broken references to the transaction record that had been removed. To resolve this issue, the record will be given a fixed URI that will not change if corrections are made to the data.\nWe will change the individual properties/attributes of a transaction record if the data is corrected in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have also removed the ‘ppi:publishDate’ property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"additional-price-paid-data-and-vat\"\u003eAdditional Price Paid Data and VAT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the price paid data for a property transaction is captured, the price paid information quoted in the transfer deed lodged for registration is recorded. Some commercial property transactions lodged for registration quote the price paid and make a statement about value added tax (VAT). This statement may include the specific amount of VAT paid or may state that VAT is ‘excluded’ or ‘included’. There will also be occasions when VAT is not mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the price paid quoted in a transfer deed differentiates between the consideration and the VAT, the price paid recorded will exclude VAT, eg if a transfer deed quotes the ‘price paid to be £100,000 plus VAT’ only £100,000 will be recorded. However when the consideration is inclusive of VAT, eg the ‘price paid is stated to be £100,000 inclusive of VAT, the transaction is excluded from the dataset. This is because we do not make decisions on the percentage of VAT that should be applied to historic transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur process for recording register entries for price paid remains unchanged and will continue to refer to VAT where appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reporting-a-price-paid-data-error\"\u003eReporting a Price Paid Data error\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you know of an error in price paid information for sales or believe a sale is ‘missing’ from information you have viewed, use our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customerhelp.landregistry.gov.uk/changeasalesrecordwebform\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003echange a sales record form\u003c/a\u003e so that we can update our records and inform third parties.

A common problem is the auto-conversion of dates to a different format (e.g. “2013-10-04 00:00” to 04/10/2013 00:00) and conversion of fields containing a numeric range to a date value (e.g. “2-7” to 2nd July).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can avoid these problems by putting an equals (=) sign in front of every field you don’t want auto converted. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e“{75520218-C2D9-4926-95E3-00061A7A3784}”,”248000”,=”2013-10-04 00:00”,”CR2 6PB”,”T”,”N”,”F”,”36”,”2 - 7”,”SELSDON ROAD”,””,”SOUTH CROYDON”,”CROYDON”,”GREATER LONDON”,”A”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will keep the date in the same format instead of converting it to 04/10/2013 00:00\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"price-paid-data-report-builder\"\u003ePrice Paid Data report builder\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccess the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ppd\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ereport builder\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"browser-support\"\u003eBrowser Support\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs of April 2014, HM Land Registry no longer tests new application software releases against Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft Internet Explorer 9 onwards, Safari 7 onwards and the latest version of any browsers which automatically update, such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"guidance-on-searching-the-data\"\u003eGuidance on searching the data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe try to make sure that our public data is as accurate as possible but cannot guarantee that it is free from errors. Our Price Paid Data reports are based on data collected at the time a property transaction was registered with us and will not necessarily be up to date with the most recent information. Because data is captured at the time of registration, updates to counties or postcodes will not be shown on sales before the changes took effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to get a more comprehensive report for your location criteria, you may need to try several things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etry using your location in both town/city and district. Often a metropolitan district can cover more than one town or city\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etry multiple searches using both the most recent and previously used towns/counties, for example Bristol/City of Bristol?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003euse variations in district in order to reflect changes in administrative areas. Over time district may have changed for an address for a number of reasons. The district name may have changed, the area might have been transferred to another authority or the area might have become a unitary authority. For example, transactions for a property in Saltash, Cornwall dating before April 2009 will be shown as district: Caradon (the former district) whilst more recent transactions will be shown as district: Cornwall (the current unitary authority)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003euse various levels of searches to find specific areas. For example, despite the name, Princetown is a village on Dartmoor in Devon. For postal purposes, it’s part of the town of Yelverton. Both are within the Plymouth postcode area and within the postcode district of PL20 which includes several other settlements on and around Dartmoor. If you were to search using a wider definition of the area, (Yelverton or the postcode sector PL20) you can then filter the results by locality in order to find only those referenced as Princetown.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reason-why-a-search-may-timeout\"\u003eReason why a search may timeout\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have set a time limit for Price Paid Data queries, and this means that you will see a timeout message if your search takes more than a minute to run. This time limit has been implemented to ensure that the system isn’t slowed down by excessively large queries. This also protects customers from unexpectedly large results sets being returned, with associated delays in system response and possible data download charges from your internet provider. If you have a particular need to run complex queries we suggest that you download the full price paid dataset, as this will give you unrestricted access to that data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unable-to-search-for-addresses-by-locality\"\u003eUnable to search for addresses by locality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAddresses used by HM Land Registry to describe land are mostly derived from Royal Mail address data. Town is the primary identifier for addresses but locality may also be used to identify smaller urban and rural places. However, locality is not consistently used; for example, in an urban area locality may only be included in an address in order to distinguish between multiple streets with the same name in a town. In addition, HM Land Registry addresses have been collected over many years and over time inconsistencies may have occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that searching by locality may not return a complete dataset and we advise that it is safer to search by town. Once you have run your search you have the option to filter your search by locality (click the spyglass button beside a locality name in the results set). You also have the option to download the full price paid dataset, which will give you unrestricted access to that data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-difference-between-transactions-and-properties\"\u003eThe difference between ‘transactions’ and ‘properties’\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour results provide a statement which tells you how many transactions and properties are being returned. While properties are self-explanatory, transactions relate to the number of sales which have been returned. The two numbers will differ as a property can transact more than one in the time period searched. Therefore, you may see 100 properties returned with 105 transactions, meaning that one or more of the properties has changed ownership multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur data is derived from all residential property transactions registered with HM Land Registry since January 1995. See the list of exclusions for further information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-order-of-displayed-search-results\"\u003eThe order of displayed search results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the list of results, individual addresses are grouped together by street. Those streets are in turn grouped by postal town, district and county. So, for example, any results in Gloucestershire would appear before results in Hampshire; within Gloucestershire results from Cheltenham would appear before results from Gloucester; and within Cheltenham addresses on Albert Road would be listed before addresses on Pitville Circus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unable-to-see-all-search-results\"\u003eUnable to see all search results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen completing the initial screen you are asked to choose how many results you would like back. This has been set to 100 so that you can ensure that your search criteria is correct before requesting the full results. Note that the sample data returned is a random sample, the order and number of transactions per property can alter when requesting more data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFull results can be requested from the results page itself or when choosing to download the results.

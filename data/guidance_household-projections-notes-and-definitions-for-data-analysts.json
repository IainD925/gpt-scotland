The \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/household-interim-projections-2011-to-2021-in-england\" title=\"Household interim projections (2011 to 2021) in England\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e2011-based projections\u003c/a\u003e are interim because they are based on the 2011-based interim sub-national population projections. These population projections are based on the 2011 mid-year population estimates rolled forward from the Census 2011 data and apply the demographic trends used for the previous 2010-based sub-national population projections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn estimate of the communal establishment population is subtracted from the total population to give the private household population. These population figures, split by age, sex and marital status group, are multiplied by the projected ‘household representative rates’ that represent the proportion of the population in that category who are household representatives. These rates are based on the 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses and Labour Force Survey data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe breakdown of the household projections into the detailed household types is given by a projection of headship rates from the 2001 and 2011 Census.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFigures for the number of households for 2011 are derived from household representative rates applied to the \u003cabbr title=\"Office for National Statistics\"\u003eONS\u003c/abbr\u003e mid-year population estimates for 2011.

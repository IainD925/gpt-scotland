It is up to you to approach a system leader and negotiate an appropriate amount. As a guide, day rates should reflect pay and expenses for a senior leader or headteacher, including the costs incurred by their school to release them. A typical day rate for a system leader is around £300-£500. The review will probably take between 1 and 2 working days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDownload the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sendgateway.org.uk/whole-school-send/find-wss-resources.html\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efree SEND review guide\u003c/a\u003e developed for DfE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGo to the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sendgateway.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNasen SEND Gateway website\u003c/a\u003e for free resources including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea SEND reflection framework for teachers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea teaching assistant deployment review guide\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea guide on preparing for adulthood\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese resources can be edited to suit your own requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The impact Freeports are already having is clear: at the recent Global Investment Summit, the Prime Minister announced that Freeports have already attracted a remarkable £2.9 billion of investment, creating over 6,000 jobs. Freeports are working, but this is just the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2021, the government has announced 12 Freeports, which are together projected to create over 200,000 jobs, many of which will be in the high-innovation, low-carbon technologies of the future. Freeports will transform our industrial heartlands, putting them right at the forefront of our journey to Net Zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can already see this starting to happen. On the Humber, for example, the Freeport has helped secure an investment from Pensana PLC to create the UK’s first rare earth processing facility – a critical link in the supply chain for green energy and low carbon technologies. Further up the coast, the Teesside Freeport is harnessing its proximity to the North Sea and attracting major investment in offshore wind manufacturing, including a facility built by SeAH Wind. In south-west England, the Plymouth and South Devon Freeport is playing to local strengths, having secured investment from M Subs, who design and operate underwater vehicles, in a continuation of the region’s proud maritime tradition. Across the board, Freeports are delivering for communities with new skills programmes, apprenticeships, and scholarships to ensure local people benefit from the jobs created. These examples show the early impacts Freeports are having, but their true potential is transformational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we press forward, it is imperative that we do everything we can to realise that potential. For this reason, I was delighted to see the Chancellor announce in the recent Autumn Statement an extension to the Freeport tax reliefs, which will provide businesses with the long-term support they need to invest, and a new £150 million Investment Opportunities Fund to help land investment into Freeports and Investment Zones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut we need to go further. This document – the ‘Freeports Delivery Roadmap’ – sets out our plan for doing so. It is a comprehensive set of measures that government will implement to accelerate Freeport delivery and maximise its benefits for all: we are doubling down on our efforts to promote Freeports to investors; we are making sure those investors have as smooth a journey through the planning system as possible; and we are stepping up our support to ensure Freeports deliver positive impacts for local people and for the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is our pledge to do what it takes to maximise the full potential of Freeports. The scale of the opportunity is vast, and the journey has only just begun, but together we will bring a tide of prosperity to communities in all corners of the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Rt Hon Michael Gove MP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSecretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing  and Communities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first Freeports \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-speech-2021\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewere announced\u003c/a\u003e in England by the Prime Minister, then Chancellor, in March 2021 and since then rapid progress has been made. Four further Freeports have been announced, in Scotland and Wales, and across Freeport locations, councils, businesses, and other key stakeholders have been busily working to establish the right structures for delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-are-freeports\"\u003eWhat are Freeports?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt their core, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/freeports\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFreeports\u003c/a\u003e are about rebalancing regional economies in disadvantaged parts of the UK towards the sectors of the future, laying the foundations for long-term, durable prosperity that builds upon areas’ proud industrial heritages and leverages ports (sea and air) as key local economic assets. This is a lofty ambition, but Freeports have at their disposal a powerful toolkit of policy measures to realise it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, a generous financial package allows Freeports to unlock underutilised sites that have enormous potential – in part thanks to their proximity to port infrastructure – but are in parts of the country which suffer from lower levels of economic activity. Companies locating on those specific sites will benefit from a suite of tax reliefs on new investment and job creation, simplified customs procedures, and wide-ranging support to trade, invest, and innovate. In aggregate these measures aim to create investable sites across the UK, focused on the sectors of the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorking together, Freeports and government are promoting these propositions with the aim of landing investment into Freeport sites, creating high-quality jobs for local people and generating additional tax revenue for local councils. Those councils are able to keep all the business rates generated on Freeport sites – instead of the normal 50% share – for 25 years, giving them a long-term funding settlement potentially worth hundreds of millions of pounds - to support investments in local infrastructure and skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will further increase the attractiveness of Freeports to investors, leading to more investment and, ultimately, the creation of new green energy and manufacturing clusters and sustainable growth for regional economies historically centred on industries like oil and gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/657c70131c0c2a001318ce58/freeports_map.svg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.\tEast Midlands Freeport \u003cbr\u003e2.\tFreeport East\u003cbr\u003e3.\tHumber Freeport\u003cbr\u003e4.\tLiverpool City Region Freeport\u003cbr\u003e5.\tPlymouth and South Devon Freeport\u003cbr\u003e6.\tSolent Freeport\u003cbr\u003e7.\tTeesside Freeport\u003cbr\u003e8.\tThames Freeport\u003cbr\u003e9.\tForth Green Freeport\u003cbr\u003e10.\tInverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport\u003cbr\u003e11.\tAnglesey Freeport\u003cbr\u003e12.\tCeltic Freeport\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-are-freeports-delivered\"\u003eHow are Freeports delivered?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreeport delivery is led by a local partnership of councils, businesses, and other key stakeholders, which together form a ‘Freeport governing body’. Freeport governing bodies take a range of forms, but all are required to adhere to high standards of transparency and their local authority members ensure the appropriate management of public money and democratic accountability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal delivery is supported by departments from across government, reflecting the wide-ranging and cross-cutting nature of the policy measures available to Freeports.

map\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe measures making up this delivery roadmap each aim to strengthen a key link in the Freeports delivery chain and are structured around 3 key strands:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ecreating investable sites\u003c/strong\u003e – bringing sites and enabling infrastructure forward, ready for businesses to

reinvesting in the local economy and communities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe measures outlined below have been developed in response to the opportunities and challenges faced by English Freeports as they have progressed through delivery but, in many cases, can benefit and will apply to Freeports UK-wide as well as \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investment-zones\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eInvestment Zones\u003c/a\u003e. Where this is the case, it is clearly stated. DLUHC will continue to work closely with UK government departments, and with the Scottish and Welsh Governments and their respective agencies, to ensure appropriate support is available for \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.scot/policies/cities-regions/green-ports/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGreen Freeports\u003c/a\u003e in Scotland, for Freeports in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.wales/freeport-programme-wales\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWales\u003c/a\u003e and for Investment Zones so that they can benefit from the measures outlined in this Roadmap where applicable. The UK government will also continue to work with stakeholders on how best to deliver the benefits of the Freeports and Investment Zones programmes in Northern Ireland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"creating-investable-sites\"\u003e1. Creating investable sites\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreeports aim to bring forward dormant sites for rapid development, including major projects in nascent sectors. These are complex undertakings with long lead times and so it is crucial that government does all it can to accelerate enabling processes, including planning consenting and infrastructure delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"infrastructure\"\u003eInfrastructure\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince Freeports focus on attracting new investment to previously underutilised sites, in many cases enabling works are required to prepare sites for development. This may include remediating contaminated land, upgrading transport links, or demolishing old and unwanted structures. Where the cost of these works, or the risks associated with them, are so great that it is unrealistic to expect the private sector alone to meet them, it is necessary for government to provide support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransport is a key enabler for the development of sites, both in the immediate vicinity and across wider strategic transport networks. The Department for Transport will therefore ensure the needs of Freeports are considered in transport funding decisions and that their impacts on the transport network are accounted for in scheme appraisal work. For example, as £36 billion of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/network-north\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNetwork North\u003c/a\u003e transport investments (which includes transport investment across the country) are made, DfT will also ensure that opportunities to maximise the benefits of Freeports are considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccess to financing can also be a constraint. Where Freeport sites require significant up-front enabling works, the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ukib.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Infrastructure Bank\u003c/a\u003e (UKIB) will proactively engage Freeports, providing expert advisory support and exploring options to provide flexible loans to Freeport local authorities and debt, equity, and government backed guarantees to private sector partners for eligible projects. DLUHC will also work with Freeports and across government to develop bespoke solutions for sites facing financing constraints, including exploring possible avenues for further government funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government also recognises that wait times for electricity grid connectivity can be a source of delays for the delivery of Freeport sites. The government is working closely with \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOfgem\u003c/a\u003e and network companies to ensure sufficient network capacity and accelerate grid connections: £3.1 billion has been allocated for network upgrades between 2023 and 2028.  The \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/655dd873d03a8d001207fe56/connections-action-plan.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eConnections Action Plan\u003c/a\u003e, published jointly with Ofgem, will drastically reduce the time it takes viable projects to connect to the grid. Through reforms to grid connections, government aims to reduce the average delay a viable project faces to connect to the transmission network from 5 years to 6 months with the ambition that the significant majority of projects, including those within Freeports, can connect in line with their realistic project requirements. Ofgem have published their decision to grant the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nationalgrideso.com/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eElectricity System Operator\u003c/a\u003e powers to remove stalled, speculative or unviable projects from the connections queue if they cannot meet key milestones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDESNZ will work with Ofgem on the implementation of its recently announced Regional Energy Strategic Planners to improve local energy planning, including in Freeport areas, and work with Freeports to understand their infrastructure needs and attract investment for projects. DESNZ will also work with the Office for Investment (OfI) to manage a triage process to ensure that the most strategically important projects receive government support to facilitate timely connection times. Finally, DLUHC will make available to Freeports centrally contracted expert advice to support them in engaging energy network stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"planning\"\u003ePlanning\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe current planning system in England gives local authorities a powerful set of tools for creating an environment that can support appropriate development on Freeport sites. The government will take steps to ensure those tools are used as effectively as possible and to minimise friction at key stages in the planning process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government will ensure that relevant national planning policy reflects the needs and priority of Freeports and Investment Zones, giving local planning authorities and businesses greater certainty and clarity. This will include the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Planning Policy Framework\u003c/a\u003e (NPPF), new \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/levelling-up-and-regeneration-bill-reforms-to-national-planning-policy/levelling-up-and-regeneration-bill-reforms-to-national-planning-policy#chapter-10--national-development-management-policies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Development Management Policies\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/review-of-the-national-policy-statement-for-ports\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Policy Statement for Ports\u003c/a\u003e and the associated Planning Practice Guidance around Ports and Transport.

The Act gives English local authorities clearer powers to use CPOs to deliver regeneration outcomes, while streamlining the CPO process and reforming land compensation rules to ensure they are fair. The Act also introduces powers for the government to create a new, mandatory \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/55/part/4/enacted\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eInfrastructure Levy\u003c/a\u003e, which will aim to generate more funding for affordable housing and infrastructure from development in areas like Freeports. Finally, the Act enhances the statutory framework for development corporations, ensuring they have the powers and functions necessary to unlock strategic development in all parts of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Statutory-consultees\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eStatutory Consultees\u003c/a\u003e have an important role in the planning process, providing timely advice to decision makers and developers to help them ensure that Freeport developments meet planning requirements and that any impacts on the environment, infrastructure and safety are assessed and mitigated. Government will provide advice to relevant statutory consultees to ensure they understand the priority of Freeports and has also announced an independent review of the role of national statutory consultees to ensure they can provide more timely and effective advice to decision makers.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure that we continue to protect the environment while delivering the new development needed, DEFRA and its arm’s length bodies will work with Freeports to consider Freeport masterplans, where they are developed. This will inform where cost-recovered pre-application advice services may be needed, for example on environmental evidence, assessments, and proposed solutions to identified challenges. Where appropriate, opportunities might be considered for embedding staff to work with the Freeports.

Consideration will be given to piloting and testing approaches within Freeport locations to improve evidence, understanding, and certainty of environmental issues and opportunities to support economic growth whilst delivering on the government’s ambition to improve the environment within a generation. DEFRA and its arm’s-length bodies will continue to support and promote the use of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-coastal-concordat-for-england/a-coastal-concordat-for-england-revised-december-2019\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCoastal Concordat\u003c/a\u003e for Freeport local planning authorities signed up to the approach and advocate the approach across others, to provide a framework for multiple permissions to be better co-ordinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, DCMS and its arm’s-length body, Historic England, will develop a Service Level Agreement for the Freeports programme with DLUHC to ensure Historic England has the resources available to provide Freeports with the advice and services they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"landing-investment\"\u003e2. Landing investment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to Freeport sites being ready for development, it is critical to ensure that the right resources are in place, locally and within government, to effectively promote those sites and land investment into them. The government is, therefore, committing additional funding to this activity and ensuring DBT and OfI are fully prepared to seize the opportunities Freeports present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"funding-and-tax-incentives\"\u003eFunding and tax incentives\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-statement-2023/autumn-statement-2023-html\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAutumn Statement\u003c/a\u003e, the government announced 2 key measures that will catalyse investment into Freeports. First, the window for claiming the Freeport tax reliefs will be extended by 5 years. This is a recognition of their effectiveness in attracting private sector investment as well as the importance of giving businesses the long-term certainty to invest, especially in complex, innovative projects with long lead times. This extension will have an immediate impact on these commercial decisions, boosting investment here and now. Second, the government is creating a £150 million fund to support Freeports and Investment Zones across the UK to secure business investment opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo ensure Freeports are equipped to seize the opportunities these measures create and to effectively market themselves and attract investment, the government will explore options for helping Freeports to increase local delivery capacity. In parallel, DLUHC will also review reporting requirements placed on Freeports to ensure requests are streamlined and proportionate, so that Freeports can stay focused on their core mission of delivering investment and creating jobs in their local economies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"investment-promotion\"\u003eInvestment promotion\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government actively promotes Freeports and Investment Zones to potential inward investors through DBT and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-investment\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOFI\u003c/a\u003e. In recognition of the size of the opportunity, DBT has expanded the resourcing of its Freeports and Investment Zones investment attraction functions and will prioritise the promotion of each at investor events. The Department’s resourcing arrangements in support of both programmes will also be kept under review to ensure they remain suitable for the evolving opportunities and requirements of Freeports and Investment Zones as they progress into delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDBT will also recognise Freeports and Investment Zones as a key promotional priority within the objectives of its investor-facing network. In support of this, the Department will develop key marketing materials for Freeports and Investment Zones and will profile and proactively engage target investors for each Freeport and Investment Zone site. Where sites face barriers to investment, DLUHC and DBT will commit to bringing together relevant departments and agencies to respond to those barriers in a targeted way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOfI will coordinate cross-government efforts to promote those Freeport and Investment Zone opportunities that are the most investment-ready and will provide end-to-end support to investors to land high value investment aligned to strategic sectors, for example, Net Zero, Science and Technology and Advanced Manufacturing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecognising the complementarity of the Freeports and Investment Zone programmes, the government will continue to ensure these remain aligned, including by developing unified messaging and branding to ensure that, when promoting Freeports and Investment Zones to investors, it is clear how the programmes complement one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"creating-clusters-and-local-economic-growth\"\u003e3. Creating clusters and local economic growth\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ability of Freeports to achieve long-term and far-reaching economic impacts will depend on nurturing the components of durable growth. This means they will need to positively develop their local labour markets, create an innovative and collaborative environment for businesses and futureproof their growth by seizing opportunities to decarbonise. Freeports have a powerful arsenal of incentives to achieve these aims but will also need help from government to ensure they remain aligned with, and are fully benefitting from, wider policy in these areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreeports will need to play an active role in their local labour markets, both to ensure that local people are able to access and fully benefit from the jobs they create and to develop the specialist skills needed to attract high-innovation businesses in emerging sectors. To achieve this, they will need to work closely with a wide range of local and national partners and the government stands ready to support them with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDfE will establish linkages between key partners and Freeports to strengthen the skills offer available to Freeports, including sharing best practice and lessons learnt. DfE place-based teams will provide support to better position skills providers to respond effectively to the local needs of Freeport and Investment Zone areas, maximising the benefits felt by communities in their regions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDfE will champion joint working between Freeports/Investment Zones and local colleges which will support the creation of a pipeline of highly skilled local workers and will work to join up government skills initiatives and promote and improve enrolment in apprenticeships, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eskills bootcamps\u003c/a\u003e and other relevant skills routes.

To achieve this, DSIT will work closely with DLUHC to ensure that the design and implementation of innovation policy and funding is cognisant of Freeports and Investment Zones and will explore options for supporting their development as innovative clusters at future spending reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, DSIT will work with DLUHC to promote and enhance the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/freeports\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFreeports Regulation Engagement Network\u003c/a\u003e (FREN). DSIT will expand the FREN offer to support businesses within Investment Zones and, drawing on the expertise of DBT’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/smarter-regulation\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSmarter Regulation programme\u003c/a\u003e, will widen its focus beyond regulatory innovation to address broader regulatory barriers to business investment. The FREN will work with other government departments to explore, and develop a plan for implementing, pro-innovation regulatory tools, such as regulatory sandboxes, within Freeports and Investment Zones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government also aims to place Freeports at the forefront of border innovation and the ambition, articulated in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2025-uk-border-strategy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e2025 UK Border Strategy\u003c/a\u003e, to have the world’s most effective border. To achieve this, the government is establishing the Freeports Border Innovation Forum, which will bring border, trade, and customs policymakers together from across government to consider opportunities to supplement the existing Freeports customs offer with new technologies and innovations, support Freeports to deliver the necessary enabling infrastructure, and to integrate technology and data into our border to make trade truly digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"decarbonisation\"\u003eDecarbonisation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreeports can be at the vanguard of our journey to Net Zero, helping refocus critical, historically carbon-intensive economies like Teesside, the Humber, the Cromarty Firth, and Milford Haven towards green energy and industry.

The government will continue to engage with the ports sector – including relevant Freeports and Investment Zones, which will be assigned a dedicated point of contact within DESNZ – to develop a shared understanding of the barriers to offshore wind investment and identify potential solutions to overcome them. For example, the government is developing proposals that, if taken forward, could provide support to offshore wind projects that take significant action to boost the sustainability of their supply chains through the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/introducing-a-contracts-for-difference-cfd-sustainable-industry-reward#:~:text=The%20CfD%20Sustainable%20Industry%20Reward%20aims%20to%20help%20accelerate%20the,challenges%20identified%20by%20the%20industry.\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eContract for Difference Sustainable Industry Reward Scheme\u003c/a\u003e, currently out for public consultation.

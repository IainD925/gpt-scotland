It is important to check in advance if the evaluation you have designed will work, which may mean carrying out a feasibility study. This is especially true for more expensive evaluations, such as comparative studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA feasibility study can be used after your product is developed (summative evaluation). It can help you to pilot your study design, recruitment and data collections methods. The main idea is to conduct a smaller-scale study recruiting participants similar to people you would want to use your digital product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pros\"\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBenefits include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eidentifying any problems with the study before running a full-scale evaluation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean opportunity to refine the design, which can decrease missing data\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etesting the practicalities of implementing an intervention to avoid any technical challenges when assessing the digital product\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cons\"\u003eCons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDrawbacks include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eadditional time and effort\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emay tell you that it is hard to recruit people but might not tell you why; to answer this, conduct \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/choose-evaluation-methods-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003equalitative studies\u003c/a\u003e with the participants\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-a-feasibility-study\"\u003eHow to carry out a feasibility study\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany factors can affect whether you will be able to conduct your planned evaluation study, for example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecost\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etiming\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eparticipant burden\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elikely response rates\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhether measuring something affects the outcome.

For example, if the study is not acceptable to your participants, then it might not be feasible to carry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFeasibility studies can help you answer questions like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis it possible to recruit participants to my study? You could answer this by looking at the recruitment rates\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eonce participants are in the study, do they stay in the study? You could answer this by looking at the retention rates\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eare the participants willing to take part in follow-ups, including data collection? You could answer this question by looking at the survey completion rates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou could also look at the preliminary results of your outcome measures. As a feasibility study is on a small scale, you cannot conclude much from the results. However, you could look at the trends in your results and use the data to inform power calculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou could also include a qualitative component in the study that will help you to understand why some of the results were observed. For example, if you found low follow-up rates for some outcomes measures, you might want to ask the participants what made them skip or disengage from filling in a survey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you find that some parts of your study design are difficult to carry out or do not seem suitable for participants, you can refine and improve these aspects for your full-scale study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA feasibility study tries to replicate the whole procedure of an evaluation, but you could also carry out smaller pilots of parts of an evaluation. For example, you could pilot a survey tool on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-text-messaging-interventions-to-engage-young-people-diagnosed-with-hiv-with-care\"\u003eExample: text messaging interventions to engage young people diagnosed with HIV with care\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrujillo and others (2020), \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/1/e16838/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDigital HIV Care Navigation for Young People Living With HIV in San Francisco, California: Feasibility and Acceptability Study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team conducted a study assessing feasibility and acceptability of a text message-based intervention for young people living with HIV who experience issues with engaging with HIV care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey used quantitative and qualitative methods to assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFeasibility using quantitative data was investigated by assessing participants’ engagement with the text messaging during the intervention. They categorised levels of engagement as high, medium and low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcceptability was assessed using qualitative interviews with a diverse sub-sample of participants. Researchers explored the participants’ overall experience of the text message intervention and the potential impact the intervention might have had on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe study received ethics approval from the University of California, San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe feasibility study had 120 participants and 16 participants were interviewed. Most participants showed medium or high levels of engagement (50/120 (41.7%) and 26/120 (21.7%), respectively). The majority of participants found that the intervention added value to their lives, improved their engagement in HIV care and helped with medication adherence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey concluded that the intervention was feasible and acceptable, and it may provide some improvements in users’ engagement with HIV care. However, based on the interviews, they identified potential challenges and barriers. For example, they found that providing the intervention soon after the HIV diagnosis might be less appropriate for some participants, because some people might find it overwhelming to discuss their HIV status so early on. Based on findings of the qualitative study, they provided some recommendations to refine the intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5239\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCONSORT 2010 statement: extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials\u003c/a\u003e.

In 2009 the \u003cabbr title=\"Defence Intelligence Staff\"\u003eDIS\u003c/abbr\u003e was renamed Defence Intelligence (DI).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor most of its early history the \u003cabbr title=\"Defence Intelligence Staff\"\u003eDIS\u003c/abbr\u003e was preoccupied with Cold War topics. However, the focus of Defence Intelligence has now shifted towards providing intelligence support to operations overseas, countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and supporting the global war on terrorism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time the responsibilities of the Chief of Defence Intelligence have expanded to include not only intelligence analysis and collection, but also a range of other activities, including environmental and geographic information and intelligence training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"defence-intelligence-roles\"\u003eDefence intelligence roles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo support its mission, Defence Intelligence has 4 essential roles:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"support-to-operations\"\u003eSupport to operations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDI plays an integral part in the planning process throughout all stages of military operations, by providing intelligence collection and analysis at the tactical, operational and strategic levels.

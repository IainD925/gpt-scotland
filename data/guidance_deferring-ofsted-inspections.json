We acknowledge, however, that there will be times where an inspection/visit cannot go ahead or needs to be paused; when it is incomplete and/or when we need to gather additional evidence.

A deferral request should be made at the earliest possible opportunity (usually before 4:30pm on the day of notification), to the inspection support administrator or inspector who notifies the provider of the inspection or visit. A request can be made on the telephone or in person, but should be confirmed in writing (preferably by email) so that we can consider it promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e14. We normally expect any deferral request to come from the headteacher, proprietor, centre manager, childcare provider, nominated individual, \u003cabbr title=\"initial teacher education\"\u003eITE\u003c/abbr\u003e provider representative, nominated lead provider representative, registered manager and/or registered provider, or similar authority. However, in the case of a state-funded school that is part of a trust, we expect any deferral request to be made jointly by the headteacher and the trust. This means we will ask a headteacher making a deferral request to confirm that they have agreed this with their trust, and anyone from a trust making a request to confirm that they have agreed it with the headteacher. If they cannot confirm this, we will consider the request on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the context. A deferral request may also come from someone other than the usual people listed above because they are absent or ill. In those cases, the relevant Ofsted regional director will determine whether the inspection or visit will take place, in consultation with the relevant national director, as appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e15. If an inspection or visit has started, we will not normally consider a deferral (see guidance below on inspections without notice) but could consider \u003ca href=\"#Part-2-Pausing-Inspections\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epausing the inspection\u003c/a\u003e instead. However, we carry out some inspections and visits without giving notice to the provider. There may be exceptional circumstances where we may need to consider whether an unannounced inspection should go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e16. When a deferral is requested, we will consider whether the timing of any rescheduled inspection or visit would cause this to fall outside of any intervals or windows prescribed in law or by the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e. For regulated early years and social care settings, we will also carry out a risk assessment to determine whether any other regulatory responses would be appropriate. We will continue to plan for the inspection or visit while considering the request for deferral. If we agree to defer the inspection of a state-funded or independent school, we can notify that school of the new inspection date on any day of the week, not just on a Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e17. In exceptional circumstances, it may prove difficult to contact the provider. In these cases, the inspection or visit will normally still go ahead. We will continue to try and contact the provider. If there continues to be no answer, it will be carried out as an unannounced inspection or visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"considerations-for-deferring-specific-inspections\"\u003eConsiderations for deferring specific inspections\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"monitoring-inspections-of-maintained-schools-and-academies\"\u003eMonitoring inspections of maintained schools and academies\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e18. In the case of monitoring inspections, we consider that the presence of the headteacher is important in helping inspectors understand the school’s improvement journey. We are, therefore, more likely to defer the monitoring inspection if the headteacher is out of school, unless the headteacher is absent for a prolonged period, for example due to ill health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"independent-school-inspections\"\u003eIndependent school inspections\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e19.

When a school requests a deferral of its inspection because there are no pupils on roll, and the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e is already taking regulatory or enforcement action against the school, we will not agree to defer the inspection on the grounds of no pupils being on roll alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e22. When we are informed that an independent school has already closed or that it is no longer operating as a school, we will consult the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e. The \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e may commission us to carry out an emergency inspection to check compliance with the independent school standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e23. We will always inform the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e if we grant a deferral of any type of independent school inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e24. Independent schools are charged a fee for standard, pre-registration and progress-monitoring inspections, as explained in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-schools-inspection-handbook-eif\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enon-association independent school inspection handbook\u003c/a\u003e.

If, in notifying an independent school of an inspection, it proves difficult to contact the provider, we will check that the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e has no reason to believe that the school is no longer operating and confirm an inspection is still required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"independent-schools-pre-registration-inspections\"\u003eIndependent schools: pre-registration inspections\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e26. Pre-registration inspections of independent schools will not be deferred because a proposed school withdraws its application at, or following, notification. Pre-registration inspections will not go ahead if, before we notify the school of its inspection, we are notified by the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e that the proposed school’s application for registration has been withdrawn. The inspection fee may still be payable, as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehandbook for additional inspections of independent schools\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e27. Pre-registration inspections must not be deferred on the basis that the proposed school states that it is not ready for inspection. The \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e informs proposed new schools that they should not apply to register if they will not be ready to operate within the proposed timescale. The \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e will expect a proposed new school to be ready to undergo a pre-registration inspection, since the provision wishes to educate (and, for boarding schools and residential special schools, accommodate) pupils in the near future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e28. Proposed new schools should have already reported to the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e any incomplete building works – or any other issues that may prevent inspectors gaining access to the site – before we notify them of their inspection. Therefore, we will not normally defer a pre-registration inspection if the proposed school states that it is not ready for inspection, unless there are issues preventing access to the site and those issues were communicated to us during the notification call. Consequently, if inspectors arrive on site and are unable to carry out or complete the pre-registration inspection due to an inability to access the site, for example incomplete building works, the inspection fee may still be payable, as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehandbook for additional inspections of independent schools\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e29.

If local areas have concerns about the timing of an inspection/visit, they may submit a deferral request, with any supporting reasons, to the lead inspector at the point of notification of the inspection/visit. We will consider each individual request on its merits. All requests will be considered by Ofsted in line with this policy and, as appropriate, jointly with our relevant inspection partners (that is, the Care Quality Commission (\u003cabbr title=\"Care Quality Commission\"\u003eCQC\u003c/abbr\u003e), His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire \u0026amp; Rescue Services and HM Inspectorate of Probation). If a local area requests a deferral of its inspection/thematic visit, the lead inspector must notify Ofsted through the appropriate region as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"part-2-pausing-an-inspection-or-visit\"\u003ePart 2: Pausing an inspection or visit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp id=\"Part-2-Pausing-Inspections\"\u003e32. When a deferral is no longer possible because the inspection has started, the inspection can still be paused where there are exceptional circumstances that mean it cannot reasonably proceed. This also applies to regulatory visits in early years and social care. In all instances, we will need to carefully weigh up the risk of pausing against the risk of continuing, acting in children’s best interests at all times. In some instances, pausing an inspection or visit will not be appropriate, such as in situations where we are concerned that children and young people may be at risk of harm (see below).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e33.

The guidance refers to the senior inspector. This will be the most appropriate senior inspector, depending on the remit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e35. The guidance below refers to contacting and passing information to leaders’ employers (for example, for state-funded schools, the local authority, the board of governors or the trust) where there are serious concerns about leaders’ welfare. There are, however, some providers for which there is no clear employer, often because the leader is also the proprietor or owner of the setting and, therefore, has ultimate responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e36. Before considering a formal pause, lead inspectors should consider whether other options are appropriate – for example, by visiting a different location to complete the inspection or interviewing another member of staff. Inspectors should aim to complete the inspection wherever possible, with appropriate adjustments to the timetable as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e37. If inspectors see or suspect that a person is upset or distressed during the inspection, they should respond sensitively. Inspectors should treat all those they meet on inspection with professionalism, courtesy, empathy and respect, and work in a way that does not lead to significant additional stress on leaders. It is entirely appropriate and acceptable to take a break from inspection activities, provided the inspection can be completed within the planned tariff and timescale. This would not be considered a pause to inspection. Where appropriate, the lead inspector will inform the employer of any serious concerns. Inspectors should first contact a senior inspector (including through the regional duty desk) or Regulatory inspection manager (\u003cabbr title=\"Regulatory inspection manager\"\u003eRIM\u003c/abbr\u003e)/senior officer (\u003cabbr title=\"senior officer\"\u003eSO\u003c/abbr\u003e) or quality assurance manager, where practical to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e38. Prior to or on arrival at the setting, the lead inspector will normally ask leaders who is responsible for their welfare (usually their employer). Where applicable, inspectors will record the contact details of this individual or organisation, if given. If there is not an employer, leaders can provide the name of someone else who we may contact in an emergency. Prior to any such contact, inspectors should first contact a senior inspector (including through the regional duty desk) or \u003cabbr title=\"Regulatory inspection manager\"\u003eRIM\u003c/abbr\u003e/\u003cabbr title=\"senior officer\"\u003eSO\u003c/abbr\u003e or quality assurance manager, where practical to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf leaders have not supplied the details of their employer or, in an emergency, a person who is appropriate to contact, or appropriate contact cannot be made, then inspectors are not expected to investigate who else to contact. Inspectors should however report this to the relevant Senior His Majesty’s Inspector (\u003cabbr title=\"Senior His Majesty\u0027s Inspector\"\u003eSHMI\u003c/abbr\u003e) (through the duty desk where applicable). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e39. In addition to any action others may take, Ofsted may contact appropriate authorities, in an emergency. Inspectors should first contact a senior inspector (including through the regional duty desk) or \u003cabbr title=\"Regulatory inspection manager\"\u003eRIM\u003c/abbr\u003e/\u003cabbr title=\"senior officer\"\u003eSO\u003c/abbr\u003e or quality assurance manager, where practical to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e40. If the lead inspector believes that all of the inspection activity needs to be stopped temporarily, they will need to consider formally pausing the inspection. Inspectors will make every effort to protect the integrity of the inspection, and so only exceptional circumstances will result in a pause. Exceptional circumstances are likely to include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ecircumstances that compromise our ability to gather sufficient evidence to reach valid and reliable judgements, and/or where leaders in the provider require support (for example, from their employer), which may be due to concerns about the well-being of leaders\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eany other major incident that has a significant effect on the routine day-to-day running of the provision\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eany major incident that has a significant effect on the running of the inspection\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"process-for-pausing-an-inspection\"\u003eProcess for pausing an inspection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e41. Pausing an inspection will usually not be appropriate where we are concerned that children and young people may be at risk of harm, or where there is regulatory or enforcement action against a provider. The safety and well-being of children and learners are our first priority. In these circumstances, we would not normally pause the inspection, but may take other steps, such as continuing the inspection but extending over additional time, or taking a short break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e42. The lead inspector will usually initiate any pause. Any provider may request a pause, either from the lead inspector or the contact at Ofsted they will be given at notification. Open, honest and professional discussion sits at the heart of the decision-making process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e43. If an inspector considers that an inspection may need to be paused, the lead inspector should use the relevant quality assurance support for that type of inspection – contacting a senior inspector (including through the regional duty desk) or \u003cabbr title=\"Regulatory inspection manager\"\u003eRIM\u003c/abbr\u003e/\u003cabbr title=\"senior officer\"\u003eSO\u003c/abbr\u003e or quality assurance manager as appropriate (\u003ca href=\"#annex\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esee table in annex\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e44. The lead inspector will set out to the senior inspector the reason for the proposed pause, and state whether a pause is necessary or other alternatives may be appropriate. These may include having a senior inspector take a remote, desktop review of the electronic evidence, or deploying a senior inspector to quality-assure the inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e45. The senior inspector will check that appropriate steps have been taken if inspectors are concerned about the health or well-being of senior staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e46. In all circumstances, the lead inspector should seek the views of the provider when making a decision to pause. The provider may wish to make alternative arrangements to allow the inspection to continue and/or so they can take appropriate steps to ensure continued leadership is in place, depending on the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e47.

There may be circumstances where we may need to carry out a further visit to a provider without notice.

We have established processes for checking quality, finalising inspection reports and dealing with concerns and comments raised by providers. Providers have an opportunity to highlight points of clarity or factual accuracy or submit a formal complaint about the inspection process or findings when they receive their draft inspection report. We will respond to any complaint before we finalise and send the final report to the school, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure#complain-about-ofsted\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eas set out in our complaints procedure\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e85. Very rarely, and usually after considering concerns raised by a provider or following our own internal pre-publication quality assurance processes, we may identify elements in the evidence base that are not sufficiently secure. This may mean that we need to take steps to secure or complete the evidence base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e86. In these cases, we will need to take further action to complete the inspection and we will not publish the inspection report on the Ofsted reports website until we are satisfied that the inspection judgements are secure and/or the inspection report’s narrative text is appropriately supported by evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e87. After we have completed any necessary further activity, we will send an amended draft inspection report to the provider for comments. We will then finalise and publish the amended inspection report in line with our normal processes. This includes, where appropriate, consideration of any complaint prior to publication of the final report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e88. These situations should happen very rarely. However, when they do, it is important that we maintain full and sensitive communication with the provider throughout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"gathering-additional-evidence--next-steps\"\u003eGathering additional evidence – next steps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e89. Further activity may focus on the insecure or incomplete elements of the evidence base.

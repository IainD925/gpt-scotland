However, relevant costs for \u003cabbr title=\"budget impact analysis\"\u003eBIA\u003c/abbr\u003e may differ because it often takes a more restrictive budget holder perspective. For example, \u003cabbr title=\"budget impact analysis\"\u003eBIA\u003c/abbr\u003e is unlikely to include development costs or costs to the patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also consider changes to disease-related costs if your product is likely to affect these. For example, if your product helps patients prevent heart conditions, then the avoided costs of treating those conditions should be considered in \u003cabbr title=\"budget impact analysis\"\u003eBIA\u003c/abbr\u003e. This is particularly relevant when your product is expected to have an immediate impact on disease-related expenditure, which may be the case with acute conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"report-the-results\"\u003e5.\t Report the results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBudget impact results should be reported in a disaggregated way – that is, with main cost components reported individually.

The budget impact should also be reported separately for each year considered in the analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"budget impact analysis\"\u003eBIA\u003c/abbr\u003e studies should include a set of sensitivity analysis scenarios (see ‘Sensitivity analysis’ in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analyse-your-data-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAnalyse your data: evaluating digital health products\u003c/a\u003e). These scenarios allow you to understand the impact of making alternative assumptions about important aspects of the study on the budget impact assessment. For example, it may be helpful for you to understand how the budget impact changes according to alternative assumptions about population size, treatment mix and cost measurements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-digital-diabetes-and-hypertension-care\"\u003eExample: Digital diabetes and hypertension care\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Nordyke and others (2019): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.jmir.org/2019/10/e15814/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEstimating the impact of novel digital therapeutics in type-2 diabetes and hypertension: health economic analysis\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis study explores the economic impact of digital behavioural interventions (mobile apps) for managing patients with high-cost cardiometabolic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes and hypertension. The analysis was conducted from the viewpoint of the US commercial payer.

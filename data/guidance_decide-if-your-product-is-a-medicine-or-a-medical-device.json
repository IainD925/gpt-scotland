As we receive a high volume of referrals, it is necessary to consider them on the basis of priority, the highest of which is where there is a perceivable risk to the health and safety of consumers. As a consequence, it is not possible to take immediate action in all cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the majority of cases we aim to resolve issues through voluntary compliance by the relevant company.  It cannot be assumed that a product found to be in breach of medicines regulations will always be removed from sale as a result of our action.  In some cases, issues can be resolved by amending product details such as claims or product formulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, investigations need to be conducted with commercial confidentiality in mind and for that reason, it is not always possible for us to provide feedback on cases.  It is also not possible to say how long investigations will take to reach a conclusion as this is dependent on a number of factors, several of which can delay progress.  This will apply in particular where voluntary compliance is not achieved, or where investigations need to be escalated to a position of potential prosecution. Although it may appear that nothing is being done, this is not the case.  In such circumstances, there is a risk that cases could be prejudiced by disclosures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some instances, the MHRA receives referrals about products that are not deemed to be in breach of medicines regulations, or which may be more appropriately dealt with by another authority such as Trading Standards.  This may be where more than one set of regulations is being breached.  We will either recommend the referrer contacts the appropriate authority themselves, or in some circumstances, may forward the complaint on their behalf.  The MHRA will not be able to chase up referrals on behalf of a third party where they have been forwarded to another authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MHRA has authority to administer and enforce regulations relating to medicinal products that are sold, supplied or advertised from within the UK.

The species has been in decline since non-native American signal crayfish escaped into UK waters in the 1970s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis relocation is the second such rescue in the county after a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/native-crayfish-make-a-comeback-in-lincolnshire\"\u003esimilar effort in 2017\u003c/a\u003e saw hundreds of crayfish successfully transferred to chalk streams in the Lincolnshire Wolds. Surveys carried out in the area since have confirmed the crayfish are breeding and boosting the population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d70d2d8e5274a097d6dd919/crayfish-checking-web.jpg\" alt=\"Two Environment Agency officers in a river collecting crayfish\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crayfish will be examined by EA officers before being moved to their new location\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Chadd, senior environmental monitoring officer with the Environment Agency, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eLincolnshire’s flat, open rivers and pristine chalk streams are a haven for native crayfish, making our county one of the largest strongholds in England for this protected species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThey’re a vital part of the local ecology, which is why we’re working so hard to protect them – and these efforts are just part of our ongoing work to improve the environment for people and nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-clawed crayfish, named for the pale colour of the underside of their claws, are the country’s largest native freshwater crustaceans. Generally growing to 30 – 40mm in length, some can live up to 12 years and reach 120mm long from tip to tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ark project is just one example of the work being done as part of the government’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan\"\u003e25 year environment plan\u003c/a\u003e to protect and improve the environment within this generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollectively, non-native invasive species cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone can do their part to prevent the spread of invasive species and protect native ones by taking care to follow the biosecurity steps of thoroughly checking, cleaning and drying your clothes and equipment any time you’ve been in the water.

Eligibility for DBS checks is set out in legislation underpinning the disclosure and barring regime. This is reflected in this guidance to councils. It advises which checks should be carried out in particular circumstances, based on what the law allows. Local councils should ensure they are acting within the law when conducting DBS checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2. DBS is required to charge a fee for checks. Councils will be required to cover the cost of DBS checks from the funding that is being provided to enable them to provide support to families to settle in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3. To facilitate processing, councils or Registered Bodies must include the word ‘Ukraine’ in the ‘position applied for’ field in the form for enhanced checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4. To ensure that the relevant enhanced DBS checks are delivered as efficiently as possible the council or Registered Body submitting the check must not tick the box on the application form (field x66) which indicates that the applicant will be working at their home address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5. Councils should ensure prompt input of check results to the case management system (CMS) to enable assurance of the safeguarding process and to enable allocation of the funding for arrivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-dbs-update-service\"\u003eThe DBS Update Service\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/dbs-update-service\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDBS Update Service\u003c/a\u003e enables individuals to carry their DBS certificate from role to role, if within the same workforce and where the same type and level of certificate is required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils may use the DBS Update service for the purposes of Homes for Ukraine safeguarding checks, if the original certificate is of the same level and type as that for which they are eligible and required to undergo for the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils should ensure that the DBS certificate provided is at the required level of check, is for the correct workforce, and includes searches of the relevant barred lists, as set out in this guidance. Where this is not the case, councils must conduct new checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen using the DBS Update Service, councils must check the original DBS certificate. This is because the Update Service will not show information found during the original check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Update Service notifies the Council that the DBS certificate is no longer up to date, the council must conduct new DBS checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils may exercise the right to use their discretion on whether to accept DBS certificates provided by the DBS Update Service or to conduct a new DBS check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Basic DBS certificate is not available via the DBS Update Service, local councils would be expected to conduct a new DBS check on all sponsors who require only a Basic DBS for the purpose of Homes for Ukraine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dbs-checks-on-sponsors\"\u003eDBS checks on sponsors\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe eligibility requirement for DBS checks is set out in the legislation governing the disclosure and barring regime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 18 November 2022 local councils can legally request an Enhanced DBS with checks of children’s and adults’ barred lists for all Homes for Ukraine sponsors and all members of a sponsor’s household aged 16 years and over if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local council should use discretion when deciding which level of check to undertake on a sponsor (a Basic check or an Enhanced with barred lists check). This will depend on each hosting situation, including the make-up and needs of the guests that the sponsor is applying to host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal councils must request Enhanced DBS checks (with a check of the relevant barred lists) in the following scenarios:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOn sponsors (and any other household member aged 16 years and over) of eligible children where there is a family relationship between the sponsor and the child, then an ‘Enhanced with children’s barred list check’ in the ‘Other’ workforce should be requested.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOn sponsors (and any other household member aged 16 years and over) of eligible children where there is no family relationship between the sponsor and the child, then an ‘Enhanced with children’s barred list check’ in the ‘Child’ workforce should be requested.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOn sponsors (and any other household member aged 16 years and over) of a family group that includes at least one guest who is a child (a guest under 18) and they are not related to the sponsor, an ‘Enhanced with children’s barred list check’ in the ‘Child’ workforce should be requested.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhen an adult guest, who is not related to the sponsor, needs more support, due to age, illness or disabilities and it is proposed that a member of the sponsoring household (aged 16 years and over) gives them this support, then an Enhanced DBS check (including a check of the adults’ barred list) should be made on the specific member(s) of the sponsor’s household who will give that support.

If the local council decides than an Enhanced DBS check is not needed, a Basic DBS check should be requested for sponsors and household members aged 16 years and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a DBS check discloses previous offences, Councils should take a balanced view on a case by case basis when judging the suitability of that individual (and their household) for the sponsorship role, taking into account factors such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe person’s age at the time of the offence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehow long ago the offence took place\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe nature of the offence and its relevance to being a host\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat else is known about the person’s conduct before or since the offence\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dbs-checks-for-people-who-have-lived-overseas\"\u003eDBS checks for people who have lived overseas\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is for local authorities to be satisfied that any prospective sponsor is suitable. For sponsors who have lived and worked outside the UK, local authorities must still obtain a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate, including children’s barred list information when children or vulnerable adults will be hosted in line with guidance set out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/disclosure-and-barring-service-dbs-checks-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDisclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks: Homes for Ukraine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, local authorities might want to consider undertaking any further checks they think appropriate so that any relevant events that occurred outside the UK can be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese checks might include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea criminal record check for someone from overseas.

It might be difficult to obtain information from overseas particularly in countries where there is conflict. If information is not available, local authorities should undertake an assessment of risk, particularly where a child or adult at risk is within the household. Local authorities should also consider whether to put in place mechanisms to monitor the suitability of the arrangement on an ongoing basis. If a local authority is not satisfied with the outcome of their investigation as to suitability of the host, the sponsor should be considered unsuitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"accommodation-checks\"\u003eAccommodation checks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSponsors have been asked to check that their accommodation is suitable, which means it should have appropriate safety features reflecting the age and specific needs of any children due to be accommodated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The Directive makes amendments to the previous Audit Directive 2006/43/EC, while the Regulation (the first to apply to statutory audit) is directly applicable.

The EU Audit Regulation provides that public interest entities must not retain the same auditor for more than 10 years, but a derogation enables member states to extend the audit engagement to up to 20 years, provided that retendering takes place at least every 10 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government intends, subject to consultation, to take advantage of this derogation. This is consistent with the government’s position during the negotiation of the new EU audit reforms.

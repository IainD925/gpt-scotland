However, following the introduction of mass vaccination, this was dramatically reduced, with only 38 cases and 6 deaths reported in 1957.  Cases in recent years have been linked to foreign travel (C. diphtheriae) or to pet ownership (C. ulcerans).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince June 2022 there has been an increase in confirmed cases of toxigenic diphtheria among migrants in Europe. The most common presentation is with cutaneous diphtheria, caused by a toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Respiratory presentations are also seen including cases of classical respiratory diphtheria with a membrane. Most cases diagnosed in England have arrived recently and are likely to have acquired their infection during their journey to the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRespiratory symptoms and signs include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epresence of sore throat\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efever\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eadherent greyish membrane (bleeds when manipulated or dislodged) of the tonsils, pharynx or nose (but noting a membrane may not always be present)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eother presentations: endocardial, optic, conjunctival, genital, laryngeal skin lesions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClinicians should have a high index of suspicion for diphtheria in individuals presenting with compatible symptoms.

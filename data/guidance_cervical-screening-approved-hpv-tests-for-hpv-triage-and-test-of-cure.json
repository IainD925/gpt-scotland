Any additional amendments to a protocol must be first approved by \u003cabbr title=\"NHS Cervical Screening Programme\"\u003eNHSCSP\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"qiagen-hybrid-capture-2-high-risk-hpv-dna-test\"\u003eQiagen Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the Qiagen Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test (manual or Rapid Capture System) with ThinPrep LBC or remaining SurePath LBC cell pellet obtained after cytological processing, and using a 2 RLU cut-off. Sample preparation for SurePath LBC uses the manual method only as per kit insert. The automated QIAsymphony is not currently CE marked for SurePath. The use of the Qiagen AXpH DNA kit or HPV Media Kit on the QIAsymphony for routine processing of ThinPrep samples is now acceptable before the Hybrid Capture 2 test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"abbott-realtime-high-risk-hpv-test\"\u003eAbbott RealTime High-Risk HPV test\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the Abbott RealTime High-Risk HPV test with the m2000sp/rt protocol with ThinPrep LBC or SurePath LBC (either from the original SurePath collection vial or the remaining cell pellet sample after cytological processing, volume adjusted to 6ml with SurePath preservative – as per kit insert). An alternative pre-processing method to that described in the kit insert and approved by \u003cabbr title=\"NHS Cervical Screening Programme\"\u003eNHSCSP\u003c/abbr\u003e is to place the tube containing the cell pellet sample (volume adjusted to 6ml in the original gradient tube) directly on the m2000sp instrument. Contact Abbott to arrange calibration of m2000sp racks before using this method. Automated pre-processing of SurePath samples using the Tecan Evo Freedom for the Abbott m2000 is also approved. New BD SurePath vials still require approval for use with the Tecan Evo Freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"roche-cobas-4800-hpv-system\"\u003eRoche Cobas 4800 HPV system\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test with ThinPrep LBC or SurePath LBC (sample from the original SurePath collection vial), where SurePath samples have been transported and stored at 2 to 30°C for up to 42 days.  Treatment of the sample with cobas Sample Prep Buffer is \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e required if samples are tested within 28 days. Manual treatment is required for samples tested between day 29 and 42. The P480 is approved for decapping and capping of ThinPrep and can be directly placed on the Cobas 4800.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"hologic-aptima-hpv-assay\"\u003eHologic Aptima HPV Assay\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the Hologic Aptima HPV Assay using the Tigris or Panther system with ThinPrep LBC or SurePath LBC (sample from the original SurePath collection vial), where SurePath samples have been transported and stored at room temperature for up to 28 days. SurePath samples can be pre-treated using either the manual PACE 2 Fast Express kit prior to testing on the Tigris or the Aptima Transfer Solution (ATS) kit prior to testing on the Tigris or Panther. The automated TomCat ATS protocol is approved for routine processing of SurePath samples prior to testing on the Tigris or Panther. This does not include new BD SurePath vials. The automated TomCat is fully approved for aliquoting ThinPrep samples prior to using the Tigris or Panther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"hologic-cervista-hpv-hr-test\"\u003eHologic Cervista HPV HR test\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the Hologic Cervista HPV HR test with ThinPrep LBC samples on semi-automated platform\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"bd-onclarity-hpv-test\"\u003eBD Onclarity HPV test.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the BD Onclarity HPV test with SurePath and ThinPrep samples performed on the BD Viper LT System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cepheid-xpert-hpv-assay\"\u003eCepheid Xpert HPV assay\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the Cepheid Xpert HPV assay with ThinPrep samples performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Dx System or GeneXpert Infinity System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.supplychain.nhs.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNHS Supply Chain\u003c/a\u003e has published the contract prices for test kits in an NHS Framework.

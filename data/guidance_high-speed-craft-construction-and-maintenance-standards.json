The construction and operation of commercial high-speed craft is generally subject to similar legislation to that controlling other merchant shipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, because of the specific issues created by their speed of travel, there are both additional and substitute regulations that take account of the operation of these craft, whether used for cargo or passengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide explains about operational codes of practice, construction and maintenance standards and discusses the specific issue of high-speed roll-on/roll-off craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"high-speed-craft-code\"\u003eHigh-Speed Craft Code\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-speed-craft-international-safety-code-msis-24\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eInternational code of safety for high-speed craft\u003c/a\u003e was developed originally by the International Maritime Organization (\u003cabbr title=\"International Maritime Organization\"\u003eIMO\u003c/abbr\u003e), which prepares the majority of regulations and standards concerning the operation of both cargo and passenger vessels operating on international voyages. The code provides comprehensive guidance on the correct equipment and methods of operation and maintenance for high-speed craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA new chapter of the \u003cabbr title=\"International Maritime Organization\"\u003eIMO\u003c/abbr\u003e’s Safety of Life at Sea (\u003cabbr title=\"Safety of Life at Sea\"\u003eSOLAS\u003c/abbr\u003e) Convention came into force in 1996, making the code mandatory for all high-speed craft built on or after 1 January 1996. The code is regularly updated to take account of technological developments for high-speed craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe code has been adopted into UK maritime law, most recently through the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/302/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMerchant Shipping (High Speed Craft) Regulations 2004\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"construction-standards-for-high-speed-craft\"\u003eConstruction standards for high-speed craft\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe International Code of Safety for High-Speed Craft establishes detailed standards for construction of high-speed craft.

The property is assumed to be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003evacant\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein reasonable repair\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eavailable to let on the open market\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also assumed that the tenant pays for the business rates, repairs and insurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe valuation date is set by law and helps make valuations consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRateable value is not what you pay in rent or business rates.

The method the VOA uses depends on the type of property and the information available about the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"rental-method\"\u003eRental method\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rental method is used to value properties like shops, factories and offices.

It’s used when there is not much information about rents paid. The rateable value is based on the rent a tenant would be willing to pay to achieve a certain amount of trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"contractors-basis\"\u003eContractor’s basis\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe contractor’s basis is used to value properties like schools, airports and chemical plants. It’s used for properties that are never rented out so there is no information about rents paid. The rateable value is based on the cost of constructing a like for like building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"find-and-compare-your-rateable-value\"\u003eFind and compare your rateable value\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eView your property’s rateable value and how it has been calculated with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-business-rates\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efind a business rates valuation service\u003c/a\u003e.

The front of a shop including any window display area is considered the most valuable space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach zone covers the width of the shop and has a depth of 6.1 metres. Zone A starts at the shop window. As you move further into the shop, each zone is half the value of the one before it.

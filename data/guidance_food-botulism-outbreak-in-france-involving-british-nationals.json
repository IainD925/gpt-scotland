French public health authorities have identified at least 29 people who ate the implicated food, which was served to customers between 4 and 10 September.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContact has been made with several individuals across various countries in Europe, the US and Canada. Cases range from being asymptomatic to more severe illness and there has been one death so far. The French reference laboratory has identified the sardines as the source of C. botulinum neurotoxin type B and several clinical cases have been microbiologically confirmed with C. botulinum type B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThree individuals have returned to England and are being treated here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there may be more people now in the UK who ate at the restaurant whom the French authorities have not been able to trace. Warnings to the public have been issued advising any individual who ate at the Tchin Tchin Wine Bar in Bordeaux, France, between 4 and 10 September to contact their local emergency department urgently and let them know that they have visited a restaurant with a food botulism outbreak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFood botulism is rare in the UK but is a very severe illness that can be fatal if not treated early. Foodborne botulism is an intoxication caused by ingestion of pre-formed toxin in food or a beverage. It usually occurs after ingestion of foods stored in airtight (that is, anaerobic) containers such as canned foods and homemade pickles. In foodborne botulism, vomiting and diarrhoea, followed by constipation, might precede neurological symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"incubation-period\"\u003eIncubation period\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe incubation period is typically 12 to 36 hours but can be up to 7 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"symptoms\"\u003eSymptoms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn foodborne botulism, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea may precede neurological symptoms but are not always present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNeurological symptoms can include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edisturbances to vision: blurred vision, double vision, drooping eyelids, dilated pupils\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edifficulty in swallowing and talking, slurred speech, dry mouth\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edescending muscle weakness\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erespiratory difficulty or failure due to respiratory muscle paralysis\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBotulism is a toxin mediated clinical syndrome which is characterised by an acute afebrile descending bilateral symmetrical paralysis, commencing with ophthalmoplegia, bulbar and facial weakness, progressing to respiratory paralysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"urgent-clinical-actions\"\u003eUrgent clinical actions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePatients who present with any of these gastrointestinal or neurological signs and/or symptoms and who have eaten at the Tchin Tchin Wine Bar in Bordeaux, France, between 4 and 10 September should be assessed as a suspected case of botulism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuspected cases should be discussed in and out of hours with the Colindale Duty Doctor via 020 8200 4400 to consider the need for treatment with botulinum antitoxin (BAT).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagnostic samples should be taken from symptomatic cases as below.

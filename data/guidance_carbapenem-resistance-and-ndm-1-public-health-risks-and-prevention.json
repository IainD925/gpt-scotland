Carbapenemases can destroy most penicillin-like antibiotics, even powerful carbapenems. The gene that encodes \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e is often carried on pieces of bacterial \u003cabbr title=\"Deoxyribonucleic acid\"\u003eDNA\u003c/abbr\u003e known as plasmids, which can be transferred between different bacteria. Although many types of bacteria can acquire this type of resistance, \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e is most often seen in Klebsiella pneumoniae and E.coli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-this-resistance-was-first-detected\"\u003eWhen this resistance was first detected\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first case of a bacterial infection with this resistance was identified in January 2008. Monitoring of this resistance began in 2009 as more cases were identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"resistance-to-all-types-of-antibiotics\"\u003eResistance to all types of antibiotics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost bacteria with the \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e enzyme remain susceptible to 2 antibiotics, neither of which is ideal for general use. These antibiotics are colistin (an old and rather toxic antibiotic) and tigecycline (a newer antibiotic than can only be used in some, not all types of infection). Otherwise bacteria with \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo\"\u003eNDM\u003c/abbr\u003e are resistant to all antibiotics. A few isolates with \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo\"\u003eNDM\u003c/abbr\u003e are completely resistant to antibiotics, including colistin and tigecycline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-ndm-1-was-named\"\u003eHow \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e was named\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe patient in whom this resistance was first identified contracted the resistant strain through travel to New Delhi, where they were hospitalised and first started showing symptoms. There is separate evidence that the \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e resistance was already circulating in India in 2007.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is common to name a new type of metallo beta-lactamase (ie antibiotic destroying enzyme) after the place where it is first identified, for example, another similar enzyme circulating in Brazil is named \u003cabbr title=\"Sao Paulo Metallo\"\u003eSPM\u003c/abbr\u003e (Sao Paulo Metallo) and  another is \u003cabbr title=\"Verona Integron-encoded Metallo-β-lactamase\"\u003eVIM\u003c/abbr\u003e (Verona Imipenemase). The enzyme was originally named \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e in a conference abstract in 2008. The \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo\"\u003eNDM\u003c/abbr\u003e enzyme has now been reported in many parts of the world,  including Australia, the USA, Holland, France, Sweden and Canada, with affected patients often having had prior hospital contact in the Indian subcontinent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-this-resistance-began\"\u003eHow this resistance began\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe original evolution of this resistance was a random event -  the escape of a gene from some unknown bacteria onto plasmid \u003cabbr title=\"Deoxyribonucleic acid\"\u003eDNA\u003c/abbr\u003e that could move between bacteral species that are capable of causing infection. Subsequently it has probably been selected by heavy antibiotic use and has been allowed to spread among patients in these countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-infection-is-contracted\"\u003eHow infection is contracted\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCases of \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e are more prevalent in the Indian subcontinent than elsewhere, and many of the cases that have been found elsewhere have a history of hospitalisation in the Indian subcontinent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome patients contract these resistant bacterial strains when they were in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh; they may be infected by the bacteria or may just become colonised (this means that they carry the bacteria harmlessly in their gut). Some needed emergency hospitalisation during travel, some were in poor health and divided their time and treatment between the UK and the Indian subcontinent, others travelled for medical tourism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-risk-to-travellers\"\u003eThe risk to travellers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere appears to be minimal risk of infection to travellers to the Indian subcontinent who are not treated in hospital. If members of the public are travelling for surgery overseas they should satisfy themselves that appropriate infection control measures are in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-prevent-infection\"\u003eHow to prevent infection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHospitals and healthcare professionals need to pay careful attention to the correct and appropriate use of antibiotics, ensure there is appropriate monitoring and surveillance of antibiotic resistance, and ensure appropriate infection control measures are in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo prevent spread of the resistant bacteria within hospitals it is important to practice good hygiene especially hand hygiene, and for healthcare professionals to use gloves and gowns where appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor advice on how hospital laboratories can detect carbapenem-resistant bacteria and prevent them from spreading, see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/carbapenem-resistance-guidance-data-and-analysis\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecarbapenem resistance document collection\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-severity-of-this-problem\"\u003eThe severity of this problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe emergence of carbapenemases and carbapenem resistance is a major public health concern. The World Health Organization is emphasising this and the need for new antibiotics to be developed, and for countries to take action to combat antimicrobial resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-danger-of-bacterial-infections-that-have-ndm-1\"\u003eThe danger of bacterial infections that have \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInfections have varied from being mild to potentially life threatening or fatal. The level of risk depends upon which part of the body is affected by the infection, and the general health of the patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-symptoms-of-bacterial-infections-that-have-ndm-1-or-other-carbapenemases\"\u003eThe symptoms of bacterial infections that have \u003cabbr title=\"New-Delhi metallo beta-lactamase\"\u003eNDM-1\u003c/abbr\u003e or other carbapenemases\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no common symptoms as the resistance can be expressed by a number of different types of bacteria, and symptoms vary with the site of infection. The bacteria cause opportunistic infections in hospital patients, with common sites of infection including: the blood, urinary tract, lungs, and wounds. The resistance makes the infections much harder to treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

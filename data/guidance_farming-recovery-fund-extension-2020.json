Storm Dennis was the fourth named storm of the 2019/20 season, characterised by heavy and persistent rain, between 50 and 100mm, falling onto already saturated land and resulting in widespread flooding across parts of England.  The rainfall led to exceptional catchment and river responses with record breaking peak river levels and flooding occurring across Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, North and East Yorkshire.  During this period there were record breaking peak river levels along the Severn, the second highest upstream from Worcester since the late 1970s.  Levels on the Teme were in the top three recorded, with records dating back to 1956.  The Trent recorded the highest peak on record since 1959.  Based on this evidence, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recognises that the affected areas have suffered a natural disaster within the meaning of EU Regulation (EU) 702/2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"gloucestershire\"\u003eGloucestershire\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Gloucestershire there were peaks on the fluvial Severn of 3rd highest since 1975.  Downstream of Gloucester to Fishing House in the tidal sections of the Severn, peak river levels coincided with some of the highest tides on record since 1936.\nRiver Severn is eligible from Tewkesbury to Fishing House south of Gloucester (including the Coombe Hill Canal).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"worcestershire\"\u003eWorcestershire\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Worcestershire there were 2nd highest peaks on record at a number of locations on the Severn and the Teme recorded high river levels including at Bransford where river levels were the 2nd highest since records began in 1993.\nRiver Severn is eligible along its length within Worcestershire.\nRiver Teme is eligible from its confluence with the River Severn to Tenbury Wells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"herefordshire\"\u003eHerefordshire\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Herefordshire the Wye and Lugg had peaks that were the highest on record at a number of locations within the county.  The Arrow had peaks of the 2nd highest on record and the Teme recorded the highest level at Leintwardine since records began in 1998.\nRivers Wye, Lugg, Arrow and Teme are eligible along their lengths within Herefordshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"shropshire\"\u003eShropshire\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Shropshire the Severn recorded its 2nd highest peaks at a number of locations within the county since records started in 1952.

The Trent through Nottinghamshire recorded high peak levels, the river gauge at Colwick sluices recorded the 2nd highest river level since the 2000 floods.\nRiver Trent is eligible along its length within Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"east-and-north-yorkshire\"\u003eEast and North Yorkshire\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn East and North Yorkshire, the River Aire and its washlands were impacted by high tides coinciding with peak river levels. The adjoining Aire washlands, designed to store flood waters, rapidly filled and reached capacity.  The Snaith Ings overtopped via an ancillary spillway in East Cowick, resulting in the flooding of property and land to the south, something that had not previously been experienced.\nRiver Aire is eligible from south of Byram to Newland, excluding washlands/flood storage areas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

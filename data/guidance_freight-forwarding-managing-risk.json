This means booking cargo with shipping lines, airlines, rail or road carriers. Some freight forwarders have their own road transport and may carry the goods themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA forwarder’s other responsibilities include preparing and checking bills of carriage, arranging insurance, ensuring the lowest possible customs charges are levied and, where necessary, arranging storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide shows how trading conditions and insurance are used to limit the financial risk for forwarders. It also explains international trade finance and international commercial terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"trading-conditions-and-limiting-liability-for-freight-forwarders\"\u003eTrading conditions and limiting liability for freight forwarders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll businesses are subject to a wide range of statutory regulations, for example employment law, health and safety, public liability and accounting standards. There are also legal issues which specifically affect freight forwarders and their customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe role of the freight forwarder is to make arrangements which enable goods to travel from seller to buyer. This often involves a journey of several thousand miles, using more than one mode of transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere must have been a sale and contract agreed between a seller and buyer for the supply of goods before a freight forwarder is needed. Many of the elements of this contract impact directly on the nature and detail of the contract eventually agreed between the forwarder and their client, which could be the seller or buyer of the goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"trading-conditions\"\u003eTrading conditions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make sure the client and the forwarder fully understand, and agree on their responsibilities in the transportation process, the client must be made aware of the forwarder’s trading conditions. This needs to be done before details of the contract are agreed, ideally at the quotation stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrading conditions establish the circumstances under which any service is provided and usually include limiting the forwarder’s liability in the event of a claim against them. Failure to do this could leave the forwarder with unlimited liability, which could prove costly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrading conditions also:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake sure the client knows their goods are not automatically insured\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprovide safeguards to help make sure the forwarder is paid once the job is done\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprotect the forwarder if the client fails to fully disclose the contents of a consignment, eg hazardous material or goods of an exceptionally high value\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor information about packing goods and transporting hazardous material, see the guide on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/freight-forwarding-managing-risk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFreight forwarding: moving goods\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eForwarders who are members of the British International Freight Association (\u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e) will often base their contract on the \u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e 2005 Standard Trading Conditions. These conditions are for the exclusive use of \u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e members and a forwarder must join \u003cabbr title=\"British International Freight Association\"\u003eBIFA\u003c/abbr\u003e before they are allowed to use them.

These agents are advised to ask for certain information from the exporter so they do not face the risk of Customs Civil Penalties (\u003cabbr title=\"Customs Civil Penalties\"\u003eCCPs\u003c/abbr\u003e). \u003cabbr title=\"Customs Civil Penalties\"\u003eCCPs\u003c/abbr\u003e could apply because freight agents, as representatives of exporters, also hold responsibility for the accuracy of information in documents and/or the authenticity of documents attached to a shipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information on \u003cabbr title=\"Customs Civil Penalties\"\u003eCCPs\u003c/abbr\u003e, see the page on an overview of customs civil penalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHM Revenue and Customs (\u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e) recommend that freight agents should routinely request the following information from exporters:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etheir UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification (\u003cabbr title=\"Economic Operator Registration and Identification\"\u003eEORI\u003c/abbr\u003e) number (this used to be TURN) for use in box 2 of the declaration - see the guide on the Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) Scheme\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edetails of whom the goods are to be consigned to, their name and address in full\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea commercial reference that can be incorporated into the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (\u003cabbr title=\"Declaration Unique Consignment Reference\"\u003eDUCR\u003c/abbr\u003e) to assist with the export audit trail\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edetails of where the goods are to be exported, ie country of final destination\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eshipping or flight details (if known)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecorrect value of goods and correct currency code\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe Commodity Code if known, and a clear and unambiguous description of the goods, their quantity, marks and numbers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany reference numbers already issued by \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e, for example Inward Processing Relief, Outward Processing Relief authorisations or previous declarations should also be provided\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the goods have been imported, or are later to be re-imported to a Customs Relief, you need to know so that the correct export procedure code (\u003cabbr title=\"correct procedure code\"\u003eCPC\u003c/abbr\u003e) can be applied. If an incorrect \u003cabbr title=\"correct procedure code\"\u003eCPC\u003c/abbr\u003e is used, it can lead to any customs relief on duty and VAT granted at import, being liable for payment/repayment by the exporter or yourselves. If the appropriate \u003cabbr title=\"correct procedure code\"\u003eCPC\u003c/abbr\u003e is known, then this should be quoted on the export papers supplied by yourselves yet, as specialists, you may still wish to verify that the code quoted is correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter checking all the information provided by the exporter, you should also:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhere a UK \u003cabbr title=\"Economic Operator Registration and Identification\"\u003eEORI\u003c/abbr\u003e number is not provided, confirm that the exporter is not registered and give consideration to the correct procedure to be used for the goods - ie is the export a private export or, if commercial, should the exporter first get an \u003cabbr title=\"Economic Operator Registration and Identification\"\u003eEORI\u003c/abbr\u003e number?

Where identity of the exporter cannot be confirmed, VAT zero rating may be affected.

If a \u003cabbr title=\"Declaration Unique Consignment Reference\"\u003eDUCR\u003c/abbr\u003e is not provided then the guidance in the tariff should be followed. In the air environment, air waybill (AWB) numbers are often used in the latter part of the \u003cabbr title=\"Declaration Unique Consignment Reference\"\u003eDUCR\u003c/abbr\u003e yet in other freight areas it is helpful, for audit purposes, to use exporters commercial reference(s).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOwing to the increased use of official electronic records by \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e, they strongly recommend that, to help exporters, the actual \u003cabbr title=\"Declaration Unique Consignment Reference\"\u003eDUCR\u003c/abbr\u003e or Master Unique Consignment Reference (\u003cabbr title=\"Master Unique Consignment Reference\"\u003eMUCR\u003c/abbr\u003e) used or the CHIEF Export Entry Reference (EPU, Entry Number and Date) is notified to your clients. \u003cabbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e need to be able to trace the shipment through the traders’ records to enable them to help verify claims for VAT zero rating on exports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany shipments are notified via inventory booking references so these are also worth confirming with port loaders. Where goods have been consolidated, the higher level \u003cabbr title=\"Master Unique Consignment Reference\"\u003eMUCR\u003c/abbr\u003e should always be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor general information on the sector, see our section for freight forwarders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-importance-of-insurance-for-freight-forwarders\"\u003eThe importance of insurance for freight forwarders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a freight forwarder is entrusted with someone elses goods, they become legally responsible for taking all the necessary steps to protect and preserve that consignment. This means the forwarder is liable to the owner for any subsequent damage or loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe forwarder is legally entitled to limit the amount they are liable for, provided that these trading conditions have been agreed in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere goods are lost or damaged, it is possible that someone, during the transportation, has been negligent. If there has been negligence, there is likely to be a demand for compensation. The damage or loss might not have been the fault of the forwarder, but if it was caused by someone the forwarder is responsible for, for example a subcontractor, they will be liable as if it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eForwarding is not just about handling cargo, much of it is about using and providing information. For example, forwarders should know:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhen a certain ship is due to leave\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea country’s import regulations\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe current rate of duty for a particular product\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf forwarders get this information wrong, and a client relying on its accuracy suffers a loss, the forwarder could be liable. They can use their trading conditions to limit the amount of compensation they will be liable for in the event of such mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo protect themselves against risks, forwarders can take out insurance to help cover any compensation they may become liable for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-insurance-for-freight-forwarders\"\u003eTypes of insurance for freight forwarders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLiability and marine insurance are the two important types of cover for freight forwarders to consider. Forwarders must have public liability insurance - like any other business - and employer’s liability insurance, if they have staff. It’s also advisable to insure any premises owned, along with their contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"liability-insurance\"\u003eLiability insurance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll freight forwarders should have liability insurance cover. This offers protection from the types of compensation claims outlined further down in this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePolicies are available from a wide range of brokers, although a specialist insurance broker with experience of the relevant insurance policies is advisable for freight forwarders. Liability insurance does not insure the goods themselves - this is usually the responsibility of the buyer or seller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"marine-insurance\"\u003eMarine insurance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis covers the loss or damage of goods being transported internationally. Marine insurance policies also cover air, road and rail transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause freight forwarders and carriers are entitled to limit their liability, owners of goods who don’t insure them during international transport will only be entitled to a fraction of the goods’ real value. Many freight forwarders carry their own marine insurance policies so that when requested by their customer they can provide it as an added value service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"international-trade-finance\"\u003eInternational trade finance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreight forwarders play a crucial role in making sure the seller receives payment from the buyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if the terms of payment are cash on delivery, it could be the forwarder’s responsibility to ensure that this money is collected when the goods are delivered. In other cases, the forwarder can help payment by ensuring the correct documents are in the right place at the right time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSellers can often be trading with buyers thousands of miles away whose financial stability is unknown. Because of this, international financial institutions have developed specialist procedures that allow exporters to do business safely - knowing they will be paid on time and in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eForwarders must understand these processes so that their provision of well ordered and accurate documents help the smooth, swift and secure transport of the goods, and ensure that payment is unhindered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"letters-of-creditsdocumentary-credits\"\u003eLetters of credits/documentary credits\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best-known payment processes is a letter of credit - also known as a documentary credit - which provides security to both the seller and the buyer through the international banking system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rules governing documentary credits are set out in the publication Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (\u003cabbr title=\"Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits\"\u003eUCP\u003c/abbr\u003e) 600, which is drawn up by the International Chamber of Commerce (\u003cabbr title=\"International Chamber of Commerce\"\u003eICC\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the many benefits of the \u003cabbr title=\"Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits\"\u003eUCP\u003c/abbr\u003e is the standardisation of its terms and conditions.

This means good risk management is important in running a successful forwarding business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreight forwarders can limit their liability and cover some of the risks with insurance policies. It can be easy to invalidate the benefits of limited liability through carelessness or ignorance. Also, some risks are uninsurable - for example losses caused by terrorism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRisks can never be eliminated completely, but with good practices and training, they can be minimised to acceptable levels. This reduces the likelihood of unwanted claims that could severely reduce profits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that forwarders bring their trading conditions to the attention of the customer before the contract is concluded. Failure to do so could prejudice insurance cover and invalidate the protections of limited liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther areas of the business where a forwarder needs to establish clear procedures - which are understood by any staff involved - include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egetting written instructions from customers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econtrols over the issue and release of documents\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emanaging subcontractors - ideally involving written contracts\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehandling dangerous goods - for more information, see the guide on freight forwarding - moving goods\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecargo security\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einsurance claims\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"international-commercial-terms-for-freight-forwarders---incoterms\"\u003eInternational Commercial Terms for freight forwarders - Incoterms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA freight forwarder’s business relies on goods being sold - this must have taken place before the freight forwarder gets involved. Hopefully, the seller and buyer will have entered into a contract that makes it clear who’s responsible for the cost of moving the goods and any other charges that arise from this process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA set of international sales terms have been devised by the the \u003cabbr title=\"International Chamber of Commerce\"\u003eICC\u003c/abbr\u003e to remove the uncertainties of different interpretations of terms in different countries. These terms, which are used to divide transaction costs and responsibilities between buyer and seller, are known as Incoterms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhilst these Incoterms help to resolve many disputed interpretations, it is usually left to the freight forwarder to interpret them. For this reason, every forwarder must have a clear understanding of the application and interpretation of Incoterms to be able to give advice to customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to understand that Incoterms only cover the contract of sale between the seller and the buyer - setting out responsibilities and obligations of both parties over the delivery of the goods. Incoterms do not apply to the contract of carriage - a common assumption which can cause confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother misconception is that Incoterms are completely definitive and cover all the duties of the parties. This is not the case - very often the seller and the buyer have to agree who will pay what of any additional costs incurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 13 approved Incoterms. These range from ‘Ex Works’ - where the buyer is responsible for the costs in the entire transport chain - to ‘Delivered Duty Paid’ - where the seller is responsible for all these costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the use of Incoterms, there are still differing interpretations or practices that exist in some parts of the world.

                    "body":  "\u003cp\u003eBoth companies provide mobile point of sale (\u003cabbr title=\"mobile point of sale\"\u003emPOS\u003c/abbr\u003e) devices that enable businesses to take ‘offline’ payments through a card reader connected to a smartphone or tablet. The 2 companies are also active in the emerging market for ‘omni-channel’ payment services, through which businesses can take ‘offline’ and ‘online’ payments through a single provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn initial, Phase 1, investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (\u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e) had raised concerns that PayPal’s purchase of its rival might reduce competition in the supply of \u003cabbr title=\"mobile point of sale\"\u003emPOS\u003c/abbr\u003e devices in the UK. This led to the deal being referred for a comprehensive, Phase 2, probe. The \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e then announced in April that it had provisionally found the deal should be cleared. Having consulted on this provisional finding, the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e has now confirmed the merger has been cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe payments services sector is dynamic and evolving. The \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s investigation, led by an independent group of panel members, considered in detail how competition between the merging businesses would have been likely to develop in future. It reviewed extensive evidence relating to PayPal’s rationale for the merger and what the commercial strategies of PayPal and iZettle would have been if the merger had not taken place. It also considered how customers choose between the more novel \u003cabbr title=\"mobile point of sale\"\u003emPOS\u003c/abbr\u003e devices, and ‘traditional’ point of sale devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis revealed that, while iZettle and PayPal are 2 of the largest suppliers of \u003cabbr title=\"mobile point of sale\"\u003emPOS\u003c/abbr\u003e devices, their customers are also willing to switch to ‘traditional’ \u003cabbr title=\"point of sale\"\u003ePOS\u003c/abbr\u003e devices. The 2 largest suppliers of payment services to smaller merchants, Worldpay and Barclaycard, account for almost 60% of the market at present and will continue to constrain the merged company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe merged company will also face significant competition from other \u003cabbr title=\"mobile point of sale\"\u003emPOS\u003c/abbr\u003e-only players, such as Square and SumUp, which have both grown significantly in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn omni-channel services, the \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e found that iZettle would only have been able to develop its offering slowly and would have remained a marginal player for the foreseeable future. The \u003cabbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\"\u003eCMA\u003c/abbr\u003e also found that other significant competitors would be more important constraints on PayPal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther details, including the full text of the Final Report, are available on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/paypal-holdings-inc-izettle-ab-merger-inquiry\"\u003ePayPal/iZettle case page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n",

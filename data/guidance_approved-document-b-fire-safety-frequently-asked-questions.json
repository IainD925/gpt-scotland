Paragraph 1.1 in Volume 1 of Approved Document B recommends all new dwellinghouses should be provided with smoke alarms in accordance with the BS 5839-6 to at least a Grade D2 Category LD3 standard. However, table 1 of BS 5839-6:2019 recommends Grade D1 Category LD2?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of Part B of the Building Regulations a Grade D2 Category LD3 system is considered to be adequate. Therefore, as a minimum, the system itself should be designed and installed in accordance with the guidance for a Grade D2 LD3 systems in BS 5839-6:2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"now-that-door-closers-are-no-longer-necessary-within-dwellinghouses-do-i-need-them-in-an-hmo\"\u003e2. Now that door closers are no longer necessary within dwellinghouses do I need them in an HMO?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Housing Act 2004 replaced the previous housing fitness standard with a statutory framework for assessing and tackling hazards in housing - including fire hazards. Within a house designated as a ‘House in Multiple Occupation’ such devices may still need to be provided between the private areas (i.e., bedrooms) and the common parts (i.e., circulation spaces, living room, kitchen etc). Further guidance on fire safety provision can be found in the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) guide titled \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fire-safety-law-and-guidance-documents-for-business\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuidance on fire safety provisions for certain types of existing housing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-providing-a-protected-stairway-in-a-dwellinghouse-do-i-need-to-fit-fire-doorsets-on-the-cupboards-and-bathrooms\"\u003e3. When providing a protected stairway in a dwellinghouse, do I need to fit fire doorsets on the cupboards and bathrooms?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA protected stairway should be enclosed with fire resisting construction and fire doorsets in order to protect people escaping down the stairs from a fire in the accommodation. It may not always be necessary to provide fire doorsets on cupboards if they are small and the fire risk is low. An alternative to providing a fire doorset on a bathroom is to include the bathroom within the stair enclosure, thus removing the need for a fire doorset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-providing-new-fire-doorsets-in-an-existing-dwellinghouse-as-part-of-a-loft-conversion-is-it-also-necessary-to-replace-the-existing-internal-door-frames\"\u003e4. When providing new fire doorsets in an existing dwellinghouse as part of a loft conversion, is it also necessary to replace the existing internal door frames?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuidance on loft conversions is provided in Volume 1 of Approved Document B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA fire doorset should be regarded as a complete installed assembly. Thus, the door, the frame and any ironmongery should be considered when assessing its suitability. In most cases, however, it should be possible to retain the existing frame. If in doubt, the test report for the door being installed will include details of the door frame in which it was tested. Fire doorsets are often thicker and much heavier than other internal doors. Where existing frames are retained, it may be necessary to replace or relocate the door stops and to install additional fixings back to the structure. The joint between the frame and the surrounding structure should be adequately fire stopped and the operating gap between the door and the frame should be kept to a minimum (usually 3-4mm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"for-small-blocks-of-flats-with-no-common-lobbies-are-door-closers-required-for-the-protected-entrance-halls\"\u003e5. For small blocks of flats with no common lobbies, are door closers required for the protected entrance halls?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDoor closers are not required for internal fire doorsets in flats, when they are being used to provide lobby protection for a common stair. However, the recommendation for the provision of fire doorsets remains as does the advice to householders that doors should be kept shut, especially at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-do-we-say-1-bed-and-not-1-person-for-care-homes\"\u003e6. Why do we say 1 bed and not 1 person for care homes?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph 2.43 in Volume 2 of Approved Document B states; “Bedrooms should not contain more than one single or double bed”. This is for a design, without sprinklers, relying upon fire resisting construction to protect occupants that are remote from the seat of fire. Research on sprinkler effectiveness in care homes has shown people who are in intimate contact with a fire, for example where clothing or bed linen is alight, are unlikely to benefit from the operation of sprinklers. However, where sprinklers are provided, people who may be in the same room but not in intimate contact with the fire (for instance in another bed) will have an increased chance of survival. It is not the intention of the Approved Document to separate couples who happen to live in a care home by insisting that they sleep in separate beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"requirement-b3-internal-fire-spread-structure\"\u003eRequirement B3 Internal Fire Spread (Structure)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"diagrams-52a-junction-of-compartment-wall-with-roof-volume-1-and-82a-volume-2-junction-of-compartment-wall-with-roof-places-restrictions-on-double-skinned-insulated-roof-sheeting-asking-for-the-provision-of-a-300mm-band-of-material-of-class-a2-s-3-d2-can-panels-with-combustible-thermosetting-cores-be-used-instead\"\u003e7.

Can panels with combustible thermosetting cores be used instead?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagrams 5.2a (Volume 1) and 8.2a (Volume 2) of Approved Document B apply a more onerous standard than Diagrams 5.2b and 8.2b, any combustible (including thermosetting) core panels should incorporate a band of material rated A2 -s3, d2 or better 300mm wide centred over the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"diagram-52b-volume-1-and-82b-volume-2-of-approved-document-b-junction-of-compartment-wall-with-roof-places-restrictions-on-double-skinned-insulated-roof-sheeting-with-a-thermoplastic-core-asking-for-the-provision-of-a-300mm-band-of-material-of-class-a2--s3-d2-material-of-limited-combustibility-can-panels-with-combustible-thermosetting-cores-be-used-instead\"\u003e8. Diagram 5.2b (Volume 1) and 8.2b (Volume 2) of Approved Document B (Junction of compartment wall with roof) places restrictions on double skinned insulated roof sheeting with a thermoplastic core, asking for the provision of a 300mm band of material of class A2 -s3, d2. material of limited combustibility. Can panels with combustible thermosetting cores be used instead?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn low-rise residential, office or assembly buildings to which Diagram 5.2b (Volume 1) and 8.2b (Volume 2) applies, panels with thermosetting cores can be used without a 300mm band of material A2 s-3, d2 material. However, fire-stopping must be provided to seal the joint between the compartment wall and the underside of the panel. Any voids above the panel (such as where an additional roof covering is provided) should also be adequately fire-stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"if-an-existing-single-storey-shop-is-extended-so-that-it-exceeds-the-maximum-2000msup2sup-compartment-size-is-it-necessary-to-install-a-sprinkler-system\"\u003e9. If an existing single storey shop is extended so that it exceeds the maximum 2000m\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e compartment size, is it necessary to install a sprinkler system?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegulation 4 (1) of the Building Regulations 2010 states that “building work” should comply with the applicable requirements contained in Schedule 1. Regulation 4(3) then goes on to state that after the work is completed the building as a whole should comply with the applicable requirements of Schedule 1 or, where the building did not previously comply with any such requirement, is no more unsatisfactory in relation to that requirement than before the work was carried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an existing shop is extended such that the final floor area is greater than 2000m\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e (whether it exceeded this value previously or not) then the building as a whole may be less satisfactory in relation to Schedule 1 requirement B3(3) than before the work was carried out. Therefore, the building would have to be either subdivided to limit the compartment size, fitted with sprinklers or some other solution would be necessary in order to satisfy regulation 4(3) in relation to requirement B3. Regulation 4(3) must be judged against the requirements set out in Schedule 1 rather than the Approved Document. B3(3) requires sub-division of the building “to an extent appropriate” to its size and intended use and it may be that some buildings will still comply with requirement B3(3) by virtue of its intended use even though they have been extended without further compartmentation\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"if-i-provide-sprinklers-in-a-block-of-flats-can-i-reduce-other-fire-protection-measures\"\u003e10. If I provide sprinklers in a block of flats, can I reduce other fire protection measures?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be a matter for the designer and the relevant building control body to consider. However, any such proposal may result in the need to upgrade the specification of the sprinkler system and the duration of water supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"could-increasing-the-period-of-fire-resistance-to-walls-and-floors-in-a-block-of-flats-be-a-reasonable-alternative-to-providing-a-sprinkler-system-in-blocks-of-flats-over-11m-high-in-accordance-with-paragraph-74-in-volume-1-of-approved-document-b\"\u003e11. Could increasing the period of fire resistance to walls and floors in a block of flats be a reasonable alternative to providing a sprinkler system in blocks of flats over 11m high in accordance with paragraph 7.4 in Volume 1 of Approved Document B?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSprinklers are shown to benefit life safety by reducing the frequency of significant fires and injuries or fatalities associated with fires. Research by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) into the effectiveness of sprinklers estimates a reduction in deaths and injuries at 90% and 61% respectively when sprinklers are provided in purpose built flats\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e with confidence of ±3% and ±12%. More recent analysis from Wales\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e considering flats estimates a reduction in deaths and injuries at 90% and 62% respectively with confidence of ±4 and ±12%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasing the period of fire resistance of the compartment walls between flats beyond that specified in the Approved Document is unlikely to have any significant impact on the safety of occupants of the building and would have no discernible benefit to persons in the flat where the fire has started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e Cost Benefit Analysis of Residential Sprinklers – Final Report March 2012 (BRE prepared for The Chief Fire Officers Association), page 26.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e Cost Benefit Analysis of Residential Sprinklers – Report of Cost Benefit Analysis March 2013 (BRE prepared for the Welsh Government) page 29.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"para-912-in-volume-2-of-approved-document-b-states-if-the-undivided-area-exceeds-40m-in-any-direction-there-is-no-limit-to-its-size-if-all-of-the-following-conditions-are-met-however-the-comparable-paragraph-in-approved-document-b-2000-edition-para-1013-states-where-the-concealed-space-is-over-an-undivided-area-which-exceeds-40m-this-may-be-in-both-directions-on-plan-there-is-no-limit-to-the-size-of-the-cavity-if--is-the-omission-of-the-word-over-in-the-comparable-paragraph-of-the-current-approved-document-b-deliberate\"\u003e12. Para 9.12 in Volume 2 of Approved Document B states “If the undivided area exceeds 40m in any direction, there is no limit to its size if all of the following conditions are met”. However, the comparable paragraph in Approved Document B 2000 edition (para 10.13) states “Where the concealed space is over an undivided area which exceeds 40m (this may be in both directions on plan) there is no limit to the size of the cavity if…. “. Is the omission of the word “over” in the comparable paragraph of the current Approved Document B deliberate?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, this is a printing error. The word “over” should be retained as for the 2000 edition of Approved Document B, and so paragraph 9.12 in Volume 2 of Approved Document B should read: “If the cavity is over an undivided area that exceeds 40m in any direction, there is no limit to its size if all of the following conditions are met”. The principle of paragraph 9.12 is that it relates to a concealed space over a single undivided room (such as an open plan office). Because the room below the space is undivided, the occupants will be able to see a fire develop and react to the changing hazard, thus cavity barriers within the space above are less important than with a cellular layout. The conditions in paragraph 9.12 are intended to reduce the risk of a fire starting/spreading in the undivided void and to prevent fire entering the void from outside the room which is not visible to its occupants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"are-the-exposure-conditions-recommended-in-table-b3-applicable-to-all-situations\"\u003e13. Are the exposure conditions recommended in Table B3 applicable to all situations?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTable B3 in Approved Document B (ADB) sets out the type of exposure relevant for parts of buildings in common situations. This includes the structural frame, internal walls, external walls and floors. Cases may arise where parts of buildings, for example internal floors within multi-level flats, load-bearing walls internal to a flat, or parts of external load-bearing walls above openings, may be subject to fire exposures, through the course of a fire event, that would not normally be covered in single sided exposures in standard fire resistance testing. Also in some building situations, the type and form of construction may be particularly sensitive to exposure conditions and therefore will be relevant to additional exposure types, for example, due to asymmetrical cross sections or reliance on passive fire protection. Designers should consider the relevance of the exposure conditions advised in ADB to their particular design, construction type/form, and potential fire scenarios. For example, consideration should be given to the potential for load-bearing elements (including walls and floors) to become exposed on multiple faces if internal and / or external fire spread occurs. Designers should apply the most credible fire exposure conditions for their building situation, and verify that the associated evidence of performance (e.g., standard test, assessment, calculation) is appropriate for the field of application. In all cases, it is the responsibility of those undertaking the work to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"my-building-element-could-be-described-by-several-of-the-items-in-table-b3-which-one-should-i-apply\"\u003e14. My building element could be described by several of the items in Table B3. Which one should I apply?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe minimum recommended fire resistance in terms of load-bearing capacity, integrity, or insulation (R, E, or I) depends on the type of building element as outlined in Table B3, alongside the use and height of the building, with the presence of sprinklers or not, as outlined in Table B4. Both tables outline relevant minimum recommended REI performance that relates to the functional requirements of the Building Regulations for common building situations. Some elements of a building may be considered as one or more of the parts listed in Table B3, for example an external wall may also be a load-bearing wall. When considering provisions for a building part, designers should apply the most credible individual provisions for R, E, I and type of exposure. Designers should consider the function(s) of their particular building element and the relevance of the guidance, understanding the intent of the provisions, ensuring that the overall relevant functional requirements will be met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"requirement-b4-external-fire-spread\"\u003eRequirement B4 External Fire Spread\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"note-3-in-table-101-of-section-10-in-approved-document-b-volume-1\"\u003e15. Note 3, in Table 10.1, of Section 10 in Approved Document B Volume 1\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estates that “Timber cladding at least 9mm thick is also acceptable” to be used in \nsome external surfaces 1000mm or more from the relevant boundary. Does this \nallowance apply to all cases where timber is used on the outside of a building?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDesigners should consider factors that can influence the fire performance of timber cladding, including form, orientation, presence of cavities, and combination with other materials (e.g. substrates) when reviewing this allowance for a particular building situation. The allowance for timber cladding at least 9mm thick was based on experiments that were conducted on timber in plank form, forming a flat and homogeneous timber surface, over a plasterboard substrate, with heating primarily from the outermost surface. In relation to buildings of any height or use, designers should consider the choice of materials (including their extent and arrangement) used for the external wall, or attachments to the wall (e.g. balconies, etc.), to ensure that the design adequately resists the spread of fire over the wall. In all cases, designers should ensure that Requirement B4 of the Building Regulations is satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"is-my-reaction-to-fire-classification-for-a-product-relevant-to-all-situations\"\u003e16. Is my reaction to fire classification for a product relevant to all situations?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reaction to fire classification according to BS EN 13501-1:2018 is a composite classification, derived by using outcomes from multiple test standards, including the single burning item (SBI) test according to BS EN 13823:2020. For more information on the reaction to fire classification and its derivation, guidance is provided in BS EN 13501-1. The reaction to fire performance which uses an apparatus such as the SBI test is not only a function of the material or product used, but also a function of the system tested in that configuration. This means that the same material or product can achieve different classifications when using a variety of forms, fixings, orientations and combinations with other materials, e.g., different substrates. Designers should be cautious in assuming general reaction to fire classifications to materials or products and should instead consider the field of application set out in the test report for the product and account for the form and orientation, along with the specific jointing, mounting, and fixing methods employed in the test. The field of application should be considered in relation to its end-use, and any variation in its end-use should be adequately assessed by competent professionals following the advice of paragraphs B1 to B5 in Appendix B of Approved Document B. Some materials or products may rely on additives or treatments that have a specific maintenance requirement that is necessary to achieve their reaction to fire classification, e.g., a fire retardant coating. These limitations should be highlighted in the information package provided under Regulation 38, so the building can be maintained effectively. In all cases, designers should ensure that the relevant Requirements of the Building Regulations are satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"requirement-b5-access-and-facilities-for-the-fire-service\"\u003eRequirement B5 Access and Facilities for the Fire Service\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-is-the-maximum-hose-distance-in-paragraphs-132a-in-volume-1-and-151-in-volume-2-of-approved-document-b-45m-our-local-fire-and-rescue-service-appliances-are-fitted-with-hoses-which-are-much-longer-than-45m\"\u003e17. Why is the maximum hose distance in paragraphs 13.2a in Volume 1 and 15.1 in Volume 2 of Approved Document B 45m? Our local Fire and Rescue Service appliances are fitted with hoses which are much longer than 45m.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 45m criterion is based on the physiological demands on firefighters engaged in search and rescue and on the restrictions that may be imposed by their equipment. When considering hose length, it is important to appreciate that, in practice, hoses have a tendency to ‘snake’ when charged thus limiting their effective length. It is also common practice to trim the ends of hoses where they become damaged. The time and effort it takes to lay out a hose may also be an important factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"is-the-recommended-45m-distance-in-paragraph-131-in-volume-1-of-approved-document-b-for-access-for-a-pumping-appliance-measured-from-the-front-door-of-a-dwelling\"\u003e18. Is the recommended 45m distance in paragraph 13.1 in Volume 1 of Approved Document B for access for a pumping appliance measured from the front door of a dwelling?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph 13.1 in volume 1 of Approved Document Part B states there should be vehicle access for a pump appliance to within 45m of all points within dwellinghouses. This is to take account of the actual distance that the firefighters need to carry kit and lay hoses from the vehicle to reach a potential fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"if-the-45m-recommendation-for-firefighting-access-in-paragraph-131-in-volume-1-approved-document-b-cannot-be-achieved-to-all-points-within-the-dwellinghouse-would-the-provision-of-a-private-fire-hydrant-directly-outside-the-dwellinghouse-be-a-suitable-alternative-approach\"\u003e19. If the 45m recommendation for firefighting access in paragraph 13.1 in Volume 1 Approved Document B cannot be achieved to all points within the dwellinghouse would the provision of a private fire hydrant directly outside the dwellinghouse be a suitable alternative approach?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProvision of water supplies does not, on its own, reduce the physiological impact on firefighters of travelling long distances whilst carrying heavy equipment. Water from private hydrants may still need to be pumped before it can be used for firefighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere it is proposed to adopt an alternative approach to meeting requirement B5 (Access and facilities for the fire service) It would be advisable to seek the advice of the fire and rescue service who can advise on the practicalities of firefighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-does-paragraph-135-a-in-volume-1-and-154-a-in-volume-2-of-approved-document-b-say-that-the-connection-point-for-dry-fire-mains-should-typically-be-on-the-face-of-the-building\"\u003e20. Why does paragraph 13.5 (a) in Volume 1 and 15.4 (a) in Volume 2 of Approved Document B say that the connection point for dry fire mains should, typically, be on the face of the building?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApproved Document B recommends that there should be vehicle access for a pump appliance to within 18m of the dry main connection point, inlets should be on the face of the building. This is to take account of the actual distance that the fire fighters need to carry kit and lay hoses from the vehicle to the building and the time it takes to charge the main.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some situations where the 18m distance cannot easily be met, it may be acceptable to extend the connection point beyond the face of the building to reduce the distance. However, this will not, on its own, reduce the physiological impact on firefighters of travelling long distances while carrying heavy equipment.

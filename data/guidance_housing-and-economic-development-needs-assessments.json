Where a need for such facilities may exist, strategic policy-making authorities should collaborate with other authorities, infrastructure providers and other interests to identify the scale of need across the relevant market areas. This can be informed by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eengagement with logistics developers and occupiers to understand the changing nature of requirements in terms of the type, size and location of facilities, including the impact of new and emerging technologies;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eanalysis of market signals, including trends in take up and the availability of logistics land and floorspace across the relevant market geographies;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eanalysis of economic forecasts to identify potential changes in demand and anticipated growth in sectors likely to occupy logistics facilities, or which require support from the sector; and\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eengagement with Local Enterprise Partnerships and review of their plans and strategies, including economic priorities within Local Industrial Strategies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStrategic policy-making authorities will then need to consider the most appropriate locations for meeting these identified needs (whether through the expansion of existing sites or development of new ones).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAuthorities will also need to assess the extent to which land and policy support is required for other forms of logistics requirements, including the needs of SMEs and of ‘last mile’ facilities serving local markets. A range of up-to-date evidence may have to be considered in establishing the appropriate amount, type and location of provision, including market signals, anticipated changes in the local population and the housing stock as well as the local business base and infrastructure availability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 031 Reference ID: 2a-031-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-can-the-specific-locational-requirements-of-specialist-or-new-sectors-be-addressed\"\u003eHow can the specific locational requirements of specialist or new sectors be addressed?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen assessing what land and policy support may be needed for different employment uses, it will be important to understand whether there are specific requirements in the local market which affect the types of land or premises needed. Clustering of certain industries (such as some high tech, engineering, digital, creative and logistics activities) can play an important role in supporting collaboration, innovation, productivity, and sustainability, as well as in driving the economic prospects of the areas in which they locate. Strategic policy-making authorities will need to develop a clear understanding of such needs and how they might be addressed taking account of relevant evidence and policy within Local Industrial Strategies. For example, this might include the need for greater studio capacity, co-working spaces or research facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese needs are often more qualitative in nature and will have to be informed by engagement with businesses and occupiers within relevant sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 032 Reference ID: 2a-032-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

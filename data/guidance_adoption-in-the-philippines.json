If you normally live in the UK, it is not possible to start the adoption process in the Philippines. You can find out more on the procedures for inter-country adoption from our colleagues in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/\" title=\"Department for Education\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDepartment for Education\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"adoption-order\"\u003eAdoption order\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the introduction of \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1801/made\" title=\"The Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013 (the ‘2013 Order’)\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013 (the ‘2013 Order’)\u003c/a\u003e and the Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) (Scotland) Regulations 2013 and the Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2013 (the ‘2013 Scottish Regulations’) on 3 January 2014, adoption order issued in the Philippines will now be recognised in England, Wales and Scotland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"inter-country-adoption\"\u003eInter-country adoption\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHague Convention Adoptions are adoptions to the UK from a country in which the Hague Convention is in force, and which are processed and certified in accordance with the Hague Convention. Hague Convention adoptions are recognised in UK law and there is no need to re-adopt the child in the UK once the adoption is complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of the Hague Convention is to establish safeguards to protect children and their families against the risks of illegal, irregular, premature or ill-prepared adoptions abroad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBritish legislation on inter-country adoption applies to all persons who are “habitually resident” in the UK. Habitual residence is a legal concept that is defined by case law. Whether a person is considered habitually resident, will depend on all of the facts of their individual case – there is no single definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBritish nationals who are not habitually resident in the UK are not required to comply with the relevant British adoption legislation and can adopt under the laws of the Philippines.

Please note that the ‘no objection’ letter has the sole function of confirming that the British national(s) in question are no longer habitually resident in the UK and that as the child is not being adopted under British adoption legislation, the Foreign, Commonwealth \u0026amp; Development Office and British consulates have no further role in the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no scope or provision to amend the letter, which is designed for a specific purpose. It is not for the Embassy to agree whether the applicants are suitable or eligible to adopt the child, or whether the child is adoptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, to obtain the ‘no objection’ letter, the prospective adopters must first obtain independent legal advice that they are in fact not resident in the British Isles and then swear a statement witnessed by a lawyer.

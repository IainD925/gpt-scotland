It can be found in the intestines and faeces of infected humans and animals, and may contaminate lakes, streams and rivers, swimming pools, untreated or poorly treated water, food, especially raw milk and fresh produce, and objects such as farm gates and outdoor boots and clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-is-at-risk\"\u003eWho is at risk\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone can get cryptosporidiosis, but it is most common in children aged between 1 and 5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOthers at risk include people:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewho handle infected livestock or their faeces (poo)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eexposed to human faeces through caring (such as changing nappies, toileting young children) or through sexual contact\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewho drink from untreated, unprotected water supplies or swallow contaminated recreational waters (lakes, rivers, streams, swimming pools or splash pads)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewho travel to countries where these exposures are likely\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be a serious illness in people who have immune systems that are not working properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-you-get-cryptosporidiosis\"\u003eHow you get cryptosporidiosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can get cryptosporidiosis directly from another person or animal by touching faeces, for example when changing a nappy or petting a lamb and putting your hands near or in your mouth without washing them thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also get cryptosporidiosis from swimming in or drinking contaminated water. Occasionally you can be infected by eating contaminated food, including unwashed or unpeeled vegetables or salads or drinking contaminated raw milk. Cryptosporidium in manure can contaminate fields, rivers, and crops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"symptoms-of-cryptosporidiosis\"\u003eSymptoms of cryptosporidiosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSymptoms include profuse watery diarrhoea, stomach pains, nausea or vomiting, low-grade fever and loss of appetite which can lead to dehydration and weight loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSymptoms usually last for about 2 weeks but can be longer, especially in people with weak immune systems. During the illness, you might think that you are getting better and have shaken off the infection but then it returns a couple of days later before you fully recover. As symptoms are similar to many other tummy bugs, the only way to know you have cryptosporidium is for a doctor to ask for a sample of your faeces to be tested in a laboratory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-avoid-getting-and-passing-on-cryptosporidiosis\"\u003eHow to avoid getting and passing on cryptosporidiosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone should take the following steps to prevent becoming infected with a tummy bug including cryptosporidium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebefore preparing and eating food\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eafter handling raw food\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eafter going to the toilet or changing a baby’s nappy\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eafter working with, feeding, grooming or playing with pets and other animals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHelp young children to wash their hands properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlways wash and/or peel fruits and vegetables before eating them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDo not drink untreated water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDo not consume ice or tap water in countries where the water supply might be unsafe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAvoid swallowing water in lakes and swimming pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should pay special attention to hygiene during farm visits, washing hands after any contact with animals, and eating only in designated areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCryptosporidiosis is highly infectious, so you need to be very clean around your home for at least 48 hours after your symptoms stop. You are infectious to other people while you are ill and have symptoms. In addition to the above hygiene practices, you should also take the following steps to prevent exposure to cryptosporidium and to avoid passing the illness to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewash all dirty clothes, bedding and towels on the hottest possible cycle of the washing machine\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emake sure that everyone has their own towel and that they do not use anybody else’s\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eclean toilet seats, toilet bowls, flush handles, taps and wash hand basins after use with detergent and hot water, followed by a household disinfectant\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot go swimming or take your child swimming while suffering from diarrhoea and for 2 weeks after the diarrhoea has stopped\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot prepare food for others until you have been symptom-free for at least 48 hours\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can pass cryptosporidium in your faeces for several weeks even if you no longer have symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-treat-cryptosporidiosis\"\u003eHow to treat cryptosporidiosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no specific treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Most people with a healthy immune system will recover within one month. It’s important to drink plenty of fluids as diarrhoea or vomiting can lead to dehydration and you can lose important sugars and minerals from your body. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"staying-off-work-or-school\"\u003eStaying off work or school\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you are ill and have symptoms, you are infectious and should stay off work or school. You should not return to work or school until you have been free from diarrhoea and/or vomiting for 48 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should tell your employer you have had cryptosporidiosis if you work with vulnerable groups such as the young, the elderly, those in poor health, or if you handle food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ukhsa-and-cryptosporidiosis\"\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e and cryptosporidiosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK Health Security Agency (\u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e) provides advice on controlling outbreaks.

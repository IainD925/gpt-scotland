Each stage of the assessment in a crossover trial is called a period. Period 1 is when the first intervention is introduced, period 2 is when participants move to the next intervention in the sequence, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to consider that some interventions have a carryover effect. Interventions that can produce longer-lasting effects are not appropriate for crossover trials because the sequence of interventions may impact the results. For example, crossover trials are good for interventions that treat symptoms, but do not work for interventions that cure a condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the periods, you can introduce a washout period, where participants receive no intervention to let the effects of the previous intervention diminish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a crossover trial, participants act as their own control. Their data is analysed by comparing participants to themselves – before the intervention was introduced and after each intervention period – to find out if there was a change in the outcome you are measuring. This makes a crossover \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trial\"\u003eRCT\u003c/abbr\u003e potentially more efficient than other \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trials\"\u003eRCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e of a similar size. The crossover design removes the variation between participants which exists in a parallel trial where each participant only receives one intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-a-feasibility-trial-for-a-crossover-rct-of-2-popular-apps-to-increase-physical-activity\"\u003eExample: a feasibility trial for a crossover \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trial\"\u003eRCT\u003c/abbr\u003e of 2 popular apps to increase physical activity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers wanted to evaluate if 2 very popular apps could help inactive people increase their physical activity. \nThey ran a crossover trial to assess both apps in one study. It was important to check that the study was possible to conduct, so they designed a feasibility trial first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe participants were assessed on how much physical activity they were already doing before the study started. Then each participant was randomised to a sequence of app use:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapp A (7 Minute workout Challenge) then app B (One You Couch to 5K)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapp B then app A\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers needed to think carefully about the length of the app assessment. If each period was too long, participants might drop out in period 2. This could introduce imbalances that would affect the results. However, participants needed enough time to experience the interventions. Researchers chose a 2-week period for each app assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to consider whether anything would have changed over time regardless of the intervention – called a period effect. The researchers had to find out if the relationship between physical activity and each app was influenced by the period in which the app was assessed. They could then take this into account in the analysis.\nThe feasibility trial had 66 participants. Researchers found a significant difference between baseline and period 1 (after introduction of the first app) on self-reported physical activity, intentions to exercise and confidence to exercise. There was no difference between objective measures of physical activity (measured using a device called an accelerometer).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team was cautious about interpreting any results with confidence as this was a feasibility study with a small sample size. They concluded that the study was feasible to conduct as the recruitment and follow-up rates were high. The learning from this feasibility study helped to refine the methods for the full-scale trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l4378\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCONSORT 2010 statement: extension to randomised crossover trials\u003c/a\u003e.

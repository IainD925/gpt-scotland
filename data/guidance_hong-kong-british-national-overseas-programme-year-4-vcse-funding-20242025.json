There will no longer be funding for regional VCSE projects as we are targeting the funding of the Programme to support BN(O)s in line with current needs identified through ongoing delivery and funded research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe grants will help BN(O)s to thrive in their new lives in the UK – helping them to get jobs that match their skills so that they can prosper and get help with mental health and wellbeing to give them the confidence to be part of their communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe total funding for the VCSE grant is up to circa £1 million. In total, two grants will be awarded to support two projects. The department expects to fund one organisation/consortium for each grant.

We have seen strong growth in the Hong Kong community sector in the UK, which has come together alongside other groups to offer a range of services, providing over an estimated 170,000 instances of support for BN(O)s and their families since 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are pleased that these community groups are coming together to form collaborative networks and a space in which BN(O)s feel safe to seek support, and we are grateful for all their work and achievements to date. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was always the government’s intention that VCSE groups would become more self-sufficient. As a result, the government will no longer be funding regional VCSE projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, over the 4th year we are focusing grant funding on projects which will target need in the priority areas of a) employability and b) mental health and wellbeing.  This is based on evidence of need identified through ongoing delivery and funded research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

It represents, in a simplified way, a hypothesis or ‘theory of change’ about how an intervention works. Process evaluations test and refine the hypothesis or ‘theory of change’ of the intervention represented in the logic model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe design of, and terms used in, logic models vary.

These data can be used to help to explain how the intervention works to achieve its outcomes, or sometimes why it does not work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA logic model might \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-14-95\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eidentify the delivery and content of children’s drama sessions\u003c/a\u003e which encourage child-parent discussions about how to eat more healthily as an ‘implementation’ aspect, and changing family attitudes towards diet as a subsequent ‘mechanism of impact’ aspect, with an arrow indicating a causal relationship between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on this logic model, an evaluator might collect programme records and observational data on the quantity, quality and content of the drama sessions delivered to children, and interview families about their changing attitudes towards food (including questions about the causal relationship between the drama sessions and their attitudes towards food). By collecting data on these aspects of the logic model, the evaluator is able to explore main aspects of the ‘theory of change’ of the intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, logic models should be developed during intervention development, or in the early stages of planning an evaluation, so that they can be used to inform the design of the process evaluation and data collection. However, researchers can develop a logic model to describe an intervention at any stage of an evaluation, including retrospectively – for example, the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23114167/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEPODE (Ensemble Prévenons l’Obésité Des Enfants or Together let’s prevent childhood obesity) logic model\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"creating-a-useful-logic-model\"\u003eCreating a useful logic model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, process evaluations are ‘theory based’ evaluations, where the evaluation is supported by the underpinning theory of how the intervention works (see Process Evaluation section). The logic model should draw on and summarise this theory. In some cases, an intervention manual may also be useful to specify critical aspects related to the implementation/delivery of the intervention in more detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogic models are usually designed by a study team rather than a single researcher. They tend to require multiple perspectives and careful discussion to identify the critical aspects of an intervention, and to consider how they are related. Just as stakeholders such as patients, clients and staff delivering an intervention can contribute to the development of an intervention, stakeholders can also contribute to the construction of a logic model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome approaches, such as the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/rcc/rcccommbuildersapproach.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘theory of change’ model promoted by the Aspen Institute\u003c/a\u003e emphasise stakeholder involvement, while some other approaches design the logic model with researchers only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"features-of-good-logic-models\"\u003eFeatures of good logic models\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey do not include detail about absolutely everything that happens in an intervention, but summarise the aspects that are critically important in explaining how the intervention produces the changes that it is aiming to achieve. Therefore, it is important when creating a logic model to decide what these critical aspects are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey ensure, as far as possible, that ‘implementation’, ‘mechanisms of impact’, ‘outcomes’ and ‘context’ are separated in a logic model because these are conceptually distinct. An evaluator will probably have different research questions about these different aspects of the intervention and may want to use different methods to answer these questions\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey represent the ‘cause and effect’ relationships between different aspects of an intervention using arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTheir inclusion should therefore be considered carefully – if an arrow is present, the study team should be able to articulate what causal relationship it represents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey are not just conceptual maps which represent intervention aspects and the relationships between them; they represent a process of change. Therefore, the time order of ‘cause and effect’ represented in the logic model is important. Cause always comes before effect. The aspects should be arranged so that the arrows between them show how one aspect (such as delivery of training material) causes a subsequent aspect (such as improved skills).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will also represent relationships between different aspects as specifically as possible rather than, for example, listing all ‘implementation’ aspects and linking this list with one arrow to a list of ‘mechanisms of impact’ aspects. This is particularly true for interventions which are large or complex and have many different components, with different theorised mechanisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA ‘list’ approach in a logic model does not illustrate the causal pathways or theory of the intervention in much detail. Therefore, it will not be useful in guiding the data collection and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also several features of logic model design which are highly variable, depending on the intervention. A good logic model is designed and adapted so that it accurately represents the underpinning theory of the specific intervention, rather than being based on a standard template.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogic models may include more detail on one aspect of the intervention than others. The following examples demonstrate how this can be true for different aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some interventions, the implementation process may be complex, involving different stages of staff training and re-organisation of service delivery systems. For this type of intervention, the logic model might include a number of aspects to describe the different aspects and stages of implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other types of interventions, such as those using mobile phone apps, the implementation process is likely to be much simpler and the logic model would not need to include much detail on this aspect of the intervention. However, the mobile phone app may be designed with multiple ‘mechanisms of impact’ (for example, goal-setting, social support, description of behaviour, feedback, and self-monitoring).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome interventions may only impact on outcomes at one point in time, and this will be represented in the final section of a logic model. In other studies, short, medium and long-term outcomes may all be of interest, and therefore the ‘outcomes’ part of the logic model might extend to several sections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn additional factor to consider relates to the level of intervention. For example, whether the intervention is targeted at an individual, family, organisational or community level, as this will affect the content of the logic model at:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean individual level – a logic model for an individual level intervention might include detailed aspects describing psychological processes which underpin its mechanisms of impact (such as changes in individuals’ social identity and attitudes)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea community level – a logic model for a community intervention would include aspects describing group or community level changes (such as increased participation rates in a local sports facility following a physical activity promotion campaign)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarly development of a logic model is advisable. It helps to focus the process evaluation on the most important research questions and make best use of limited resources for data collection and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral researchers who contributed to case studies included in the MRC process evaluation guidance were asked what they would have done differently in their studies. They commented that they would have developed the intervention theory and logic model earlier, to allow them to address the major process evaluation questions in a more focused way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"limitations-of-logic-models\"\u003eLimitations of logic models\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogic models tread a fine line between being simple, easy to understand and use, and reflecting the complexity of the real world. A good logic model will include the critical aspects of an intervention that contribute to its outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, these may be hard to identify in advance, and therefore the logic model may not include every factor that explains outcomes. On the other hand, a very complex logic model may become unwieldy and impractical. The evaluator therefore has the tricky task of finding a balance between these 2 demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogic models have also been criticised for representing interventions as linear and mechanistic, and for overplaying the predictability of an intervention. For example, they tend to give the impression of steady change over time, whereas change may occur in jumps at certain points or problems may initially get worse before they get better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn alternative perspective comes from ‘complexity theory’ which emphasises the unpredictability of processes and characterises interventions as ‘adaptive’ rather than fixed systems (Plsek and Greenhalgh 2001).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLogic models could be adapted to a certain extent to accommodate some aspects of complexity theory, such as feedback loops (these are present in the MRC process evaluation framework). However, logic models will remain relatively mechanistic, linear representations of processes of change which do not reflect the full complexity of the real world but, as noted above, provide a simplicity that has advantages for planning and conducting evaluations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"categorising-aspects-of-logic-models\"\u003eCategorising aspects of logic models\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice, it can sometimes be tricky to define and agree on which category (such as ‘implementation’ or ‘context’) an aspect of a logic model falls into. There are no standard definitions for what counts as ‘implementation’, a ‘mechanism of impact’, ‘context’ or ‘outcome’ as these will vary depending on the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a school may be part of the context for a child bullying intervention which provides counselling for individuals. Alternatively, if an intervention is designed to change the school culture in order to reduce bullying, then the school is part of the intervention not the context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo decide where aspects of a logic model fit, it can be helpful to think through the intervention in as simple terms as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"implementation\"\u003eImplementation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the major features that characterise your intervention delivery (for example, what resources and services is the intervention providing; what activities are intervention staff required to undertake; how is the intervention or service delivered)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"mechanisms-of-impact\"\u003eMechanisms of impact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat processes should be triggered by delivery of the intervention (for example, what changes should happen in intervention recipients that wouldn’t have happened otherwise; how should participants respond to the intervention)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"outcomes\"\u003eOutcomes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the ultimate aims of the intervention (for example, what changes the intervention is aiming to achieve)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"context\"\u003eContext\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat external factors may influence the intervention (what is the intervention not addressing; what is beyond the scope of the intervention; what factors in the organisation’s or participants’ environment might affect the intervention)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, difficulties can arise where aspects of the logic model fall into grey areas on the boundaries between categories. For example, patient acceptability may be considered an aspect of ‘implementation’ since it reflects on the delivery of the intervention. However, it could also be considered an aspect of how patients respond to and engage with an intervention and, therefore, be included in the ‘mechanisms of impact’ category.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, a short-term outcome (for example, increased used of a sports facility) could reflect a mechanism of impact in an intervention with an ultimate goal of increasing physical activity. If you are having problems identifying what categories the aspects of your logic model fall into, and if some aspects seem to be on the boundaries, then it can be more useful to concentrate on what the critical aspects of your intervention are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConcentrate on how they are causally related to each other, rather than getting too caught up in making aspects fit into the ‘implementation’, ‘mechanisms of impact’ or ‘context’ categories exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"developing-a-logic-model-for-exploratory-interventions\"\u003eDeveloping a logic model for exploratory interventions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have designed an intervention, you will have some hypothesis about how it is expected to produce change to resolve the problem you are trying to address. This hypothesis can form the basis of a logic model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there may be some aspects of how the intervention might work or processes that may occur which due to large gaps in knowledge are genuinely unknown. For example, it may be that the intervention is being delivered in a new setting where the contextual factors that could affect the intervention are unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, the participant response to the intervention may be very uncertain. In these cases, there may be gaps in logic models which can be specifically explored during the process evaluation with the findings contributing to a more complete logic model at the end of the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson A (2005): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.aspeninstitute.org/content/uploads/files/content/docs/rcc/rcccommbuildersapproach.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe community builder’s approach to theory of change: a practical guide to theory development\u003c/a\u003e.

When you have failed a check or raised a concern in the CMS, you should ensure that you check it daily, as the government may require more information on the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn cases where the applicant has not been issued a visa, the visa application will be placed on hold. Where the applicant meets all other requirements, the applicant will be contacted by the government to offer them the option to withdraw their visa application or be supported in finding a new sponsor through a rematch. The government will also contact the sponsor to advise them that the application will not be progressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn cases where the guest has already been issued with a visa, but has not yet arrived in the UK, ensure the relevant information is recorded on the CMS and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will escalate this to Border Force who will attempt to intercept the guest at the border and contact the sponsor’s council to work together to provide alternative accommodation for the guest if the stop at the border is successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a council has notified MHCLG that a sponsor has withdrawn or is unsuitable but now wishes to reverse this decision, the council must raise a Jira ticket stating this so that UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) and/or Border Force can be notified of this update. If the visa application has been placed on hold UKVI will be asked to continue processing the application. If the visa application has been issued, Border Force will be notified that the sponsor is now suitable, and the guest will no longer need to be intercepted at the border.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen reporting a sponsor withdrawal in the CMS, councils should provide out-of-hours contact details in the comments box to enable Border Force to liaise with them when the guest arrives. In these cases, the council will be responsible for urgently contacting the sponsor to advise them that the sponsorship arrangement will not be progressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a guest is in receipt of benefits from the Department for Work and Pensions, they should notify them of any absences from the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"take-reasonable-steps-to-inform-guests\"\u003eTake reasonable steps to inform guests\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils should take reasonable steps to contact guests to inform them that the sponsor has not met the requirements of the scheme and set out the alternative options available to the guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn cases where the guest has already arrived at the sponsor’s household, the council will be responsible for contacting the guest and the sponsor. It is crucial they do this as soon as possible, particularly where there are safeguarding concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"begin-the-rematch-process\"\u003eBegin the rematch process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn both cases, where a visa has already been issued, the council will be expected to help secure or provide alternative accommodation, or domestic rematching. As it would be unreasonable for the guest to occupy the accommodation, they would be owed statutory homelessness assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal councils may be able to end a homelessness prevention or relief duty owed to a guest by facilitating a rematch, provided that the new placement and accommodation are suitable, and there is a reasonable prospect of it continuing to be available for at least 6 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may need to help your guest \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-guests-find-new-hosts-and-continuing-sponsorship-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efind a rematch\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-a-guest-intends-to-leave-their-child\"\u003eIf a guest intends to leave their child\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere parents/legal guardians have applied through the main Homes for Ukraine scheme they should travel and stay with their children.

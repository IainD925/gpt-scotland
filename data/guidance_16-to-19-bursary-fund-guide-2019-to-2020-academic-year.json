Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) calls all of these institutions throughout this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is non-statutory.

This will include the funding paid in April 2019 as part of the standard, annual allocation of bursary and free meals in FE funding; and any additional Bursary Fund or free meals funding awarded via the in-year growth process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders are already making decisions about whether Bursary Fund payments remain appropriate for students, depending on the reason they were awarded (the cost of travel to the provider, for example, will not necessarily always be required).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, where providers can evidence that they do not have sufficient bursary funds available to support disadvantaged students, either because they are fully committed or fully spent - ESFA is operating a business case process that will assess requests for additional funding, where appropriate, for devices and/or internet connectivity.

DfE will also be providing additional funding in the 2019 to 2020 academic year. This funding helps ensure institutions are able to meet potential increased demand from students who may need to travel further to access their placement and/or incur additional participation costs, such as for equipment or clothing. Institutions must ensure the additional bursary funding is used in line with the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund rules set out in this guide and not guidance related to CDF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they assess the needs of individual students when awarding bursary funding. ESFA audit and assurance work and ongoing monitoring/feedback activity by DfE has found a considerable number of institutions are making flat rate payments to students without any consideration of individual student needs.

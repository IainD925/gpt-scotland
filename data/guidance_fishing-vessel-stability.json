It is important that you refer to the Glossary of Terms to get a full understanding of the terms used in the booklet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis booklet is written in two sections. Part one is aimed at everyone, from the crew member to the skipper, the owner and anyone involved in the management and operation of the vessel. It provides simple information on the basics of stability, the risks and hazards and what action you can take to ensure the vessel stays safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePart two is aimed at skippers and is intended to provide greater detail on the more advanced concepts of stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"fishing-vessel-roll-and-heel-tests\"\u003eFishing vessel roll and heel tests\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFishing Vessels can assess their stability by conducting Roll and Heel Tests as set out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-503-heel-and-roll-test-for-fishing-vessel-stability\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMGN503 (F) Procedure for Carrying out a Roll or Heel Test to Assess Stability for Fishing Vessel Owners and Skippers.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis MGN has been produced as a result of the need for owners and skippers of small fishing vessels (most appropriately those under 15m Length overall (LOA)) to make an assessment of the state of stability of their vessels. Although both tests do not provide accurate or absolute data, it will help owners and skippers assess whether or not their vessel is tender or stiff in a particular condition (i.e. laden or unladen).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"using-the-wolfson-method-to-assess-vessel-safety\"\u003eUsing the Wolfson Method to assess vessel safety\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-526-stability-guidance-for-fishing-vessels-wolfson-method\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMGN526 (F) Stability Guidance for Fishing Vessels - Using the Wolfson Method\u003c/a\u003e provides guidance to both vessels with and without a Stability Information Booklet on how to assess their vessels stability during lifting and loading operations using the Wolfson Stability Guidance Method. This approach is applicable to all those vessels under 15m length for which no formal stability data is available, that is to the overwhelming majority of such vessels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process is completely free and takes less than ten minutes online, plus the time needed to draw up and paint the Freeboard Mark onto the vessel, the dimensions and positioning of which are obtainable from the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.safetyfolder.co.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSafety Folder website.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is essential to the safe operation of your vessel that you maintain adequate reserve freeboard. As well as the stability of the vessel, it is the reserve freeboard that provides the vessel the ability to remain upright and afloat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWolfson Stability Guidance also depends on whether the vessel is decked or open. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/survey-and-inspection-of-fishing-vessels-chapter-1-annexes-msis-27\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFor definitions, please refer to MSIS27 Chapter 1 Annex 3.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraining on Stability awareness is available from \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://seafishonlinetraining.co.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSeafish online\u003c/a\u003e or through an \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.seafish.org/safety-and-training/seagoing-training/offshore-approved-training-providers/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eApproved Training Provider.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

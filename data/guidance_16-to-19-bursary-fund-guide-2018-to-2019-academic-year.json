Education and Skills Funding Agency (\u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e) calls all of these institutions throughout this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is non-statutory. However, \u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e expects institutions to use it as the basis of their bursary policies and to be able to show they comply with it at any audit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"to-19-bursary-fund-a-summary\"\u003e16 to 19 Bursary Fund: a summary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 16 to 19 Bursary Fund provides financial support to help students overcome specific barriers to participation so they can remain in education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursaries:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ebursaries for defined vulnerable groups of up to £1,200 a year\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ediscretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"changes-for-2018-to-2019\"\u003eChanges for 2018 to 2019\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo reflect the ongoing rollout of Universal Credit, we have made an amendment to the wording of one of the bursary for vulnerable group categories.  This category is now defined as a student who is receiving Income Support or Universal Credit because they are financially supporting themselves and anyone who is dependent on them and living with them, such as a child or a partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe vulnerable group category that refers to a student being in receipt of Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments plus Employment and Support Allowance or Universal Credit has been re-worded slightly to aide clarity, reflecting feedback from stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe section in this guide about \u003ca href=\"#household-income\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eusing household income and establishing individual student\u003c/a\u003e contains some information institutions may find helpful where students/families provide Universal Credit award notices as evidence of household income for the discretionary bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e is making additional bursary funding available to institutions delivering extended work placements in the 2018 to 2019 academic year to ensure that institutions do not need to use a disproportionate amount of their Capacity and Delivery Fund for student support to the detriment of capacity building.  This one-off funding is designed to ensure institutions have sufficient bursary funds available to meet potential increased demand for help from any students who may need to travel further to access their placement and/or incur additional costs for equipment and clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"#good-practice\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egood practice section\u003c/a\u003e of this guide now includes a link to the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.keytosuccess.education.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eKey to Success\u003c/a\u003e website.  The website enables institutions to check to find out if new students were in receipt of Pupil Premium funding in year 11 or received SEN support.  This may help institutions to identify which students may need help from the discretionary bursary if they do not pro-actively ask for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, \u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e wishes to remind institutions about the importance of assessing the needs of individual students when awarding bursary funding.  Institutions must not make flat rate payments to all students to whom they award bursary funding or make flat rate payments to students in particular income bands without considering their individual needs.  The bursary fund is designed to help students overcome the specific financial barriers they face, not to provide set amounts of funding irrespective of actual need. The \u003ca href=\"#discretionary-bursaries\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ediscretionary bursary section\u003c/a\u003e of this guide has been split into different parts to make this clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility-criteria\"\u003eEligibility criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible to receive a bursary in the 2018 to 2019 academic year a student must be aged 16 or over but under 19 at 31 August 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged 19 or over are only eligible to receive a discretionary bursary if they are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’) or have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese 2 groups of aged 19 plus students can receive a discretionary bursary while they continue to attend education (in the case of a 19+ continuer, this must be the same programme they started before they turned 19), as long as their eligibility continues and their institution considers they need the additional support to continue their participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged 19 or over are not eligible for bursaries for vulnerable groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should generally only pay bursaries to students aged 16 or over. However, in exceptional circumstances institutions may use their discretion to pay bursaries to younger students, for example, where a student is following an accelerated study programme. Exceptional circumstances do not include students aged 14 to 16 who are attending college as part of their key stage 4 programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged under 19 enrolled on higher education qualifications are not eligible for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"eligible-education-provision\"\u003eEligible education provision\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund students must be participating in provision that is subject to inspection by a public body that assures quality (for example Ofsted).

In the rare instances where an institution identifies that such a student does require financial help, support should be provided in-kind help rather than by cash payments. For example, providing a temporary travel pass for the student to attend exams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"residency\"\u003eResidency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must meet the residency criteria in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e funding regulations\u003c/a\u003e for post-16 provision in the 2018 to 2019 academic year.

Accompanied asylum seeking children (those under 18 with an adult relative or partner) and those aged 18 and above are entitled to education, but not to public funds. If they are destitute they can apply to the Home Office for suitable housing and cash for essentials, but they are not eligible for other income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as an asylum seeker has not had their application for asylum refused, institutions can provide in-kind student support such as books, equipment or a travel pass. Under no circumstances should an institution give cash to any asylum seeker unless they are an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child (UASC).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"unaccompanied-asylum-seeking-children\"\u003eUnaccompanied asylum seeking children\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnaccompanied asylum seeking children do not receive cash support from the Home Office and are the responsibility of the local authority. They are treated as looked after children and are eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups (‘in care’ group).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen these young people reach legal adulthood at age 18, institutions must consider their immigration status. If the asylum claim is decided in their favour, the local authority must provide them with the same support and services as they do care leavers. As such, they continue to be eligible for a bursary as a student from a vulnerable group until they reach the upper age limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an asylum claim is not supported, the individual may not be able to stay legally in the UK. When asylum claims have been fully heard/the appeals process exhausted, an individual has no entitlement to public funds (with a few exceptions where the withdrawal of support would be seen as a breach of human rights).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"bursaries-for-young-people-in-defined-vulnerable-groups\"\u003eBursaries for young people in defined vulnerable groups\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents who meet one of the 4 criteria below (plus the other criteria for age and residency) and who have a financial need can apply for a bursary for vulnerable groups of up to £1,200 per year (if they are participating on a study programme that lasts for 30 weeks or more; a pro-rata amount is paid to students on study programmes of less than 30 weeks). This reflects that students in these groups may need a greater level of support to enable them to continue to participate.  Institutions must ensure that students are eligible for the bursary for defined vulnerable groups in each year they require support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe defined vulnerable groups are students who are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ein care\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ecare leavers\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ereceiving Income Support, or Universal Credit because they are financially supporting themselves or financially supporting themselves and someone who is dependent on them and living with them such as a child or partner\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ereceiving Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payments in their own right as well as Employment and Support Allowance or Universal Credit in their own right\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome institutions have asked for confirmation that students can claim Employment and Support Allowance in their own right while living in the parental home.  This is correct – students do not necessarily need to be living independently. Institutions may wish to remind parents (in any application form they use or on their websites) that they will not be able to continue to claim Child Benefit if the student successfully applies for ESA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can pay a bursary to a vulnerable group student of more than £1,200 if they assess they need extra help to remain in education. Any payments over £1,200 must be paid from their discretionary bursary allocation or from their own funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEqually, institutions may decide that although a young person may be eligible for a bursary because they are in one or more of the defined vulnerable groups, they do not have any actual financial need and so do not need support from the scheme.  For example, their financial needs are already met and/or they have no relevant costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"defining-in-care-and-care-leavers\"\u003eDefining in care and care leavers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 16 to 19 Bursary Fund defines ‘in care’ as ‘Children looked after by a local authority on a voluntary basis (section 20 of the Children Act 1989) or under a care order (section 31 of the Children Act 1989) - Section 22 of the Children Act 1989 defines the term ‘looked after child’.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA ‘care leaver’ is defined as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea young person aged 16 and 17 who was previously looked after for a period of 13 weeks consecutively (or periods amounting to 13 weeks), which began after the age of 14 and ended after the age of 16; or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea young person aged 18 or above who was looked after prior to becoming 18 for a period of 13 weeks consecutively (or periods of 13 weeks), which began after the age of 14 and ended after the age of 16\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"foster-care-including-privately-arranged-foster-care\"\u003eFoster care, including privately arranged foster care\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA young person placed with a foster carer by the local authority, including where the foster carer is on the books of an independent fostering agency, is classed as looked after. They are in a defined vulnerable group (‘in care’) and eligible for help from the bursary for vulnerable groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA child who is privately fostered (in other words, a private arrangement is made between the parent and the person who will care for the child) is not classed as a looked after child and is not eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some instances, a young person may have been in the care of the local authority and the care transferred to another party via a permanent form of fostering such as a Special Guardianship Order. In these circumstances, the young person is defined as having left care so is now a care leaver. They are in a defined vulnerable group (‘care leaver’) and eligible for help from the bursary for vulnerable groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"universal-credit\"\u003eUniversal Credit\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUniversal Credit is being rolled out across the country and will gradually replace Income Support and Employment and Support Allowance as well as other benefits. Institutions will increasingly see students claiming bursaries for vulnerable groups based on receiving Universal Credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUniversal Credit award notifications do not include any information on the benefits they replace. For this reason, we have changed the description of the bursaries for vulnerable group category that is based on receipt of Universal Credit or Income Support.  The revised description confirms that a student must be receiving Universal Credit because they are financially supporting themselves and anyone who is dependent on them and living with them such as a child or partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"evidence-of-eligibility\"\u003eEvidence of eligibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must obtain proof that students are eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups.

Students who meet the criteria and who are on study programmes lasting for less than 30 weeks should be given a bursary on a pro-rata basis.

This ensures all parties are clear that meeting the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups does not automatically mean funding will be given.

They set their own eligibility criteria for discretionary bursaries, but must comply with the eligibility conditions of the scheme set out in this guide. Institutions must ensure that students are eligible for the discretionary bursary in each year they require support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must manage the number and size of discretionary bursary awards to keep within their budget. They may decide to retain a small emergency fund from their allocation to support students who face exceptional circumstances during the year that impact on their ability to participate. Institutions may also choose to top up the bursary with their own funds to support students who are in need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no set limit for the amount of discretionary bursary that can be awarded to students.

Institutions should use household income in some way to help establish the amount of support they award to a student. This can be used in conjunction with other factors, such as distance to travel from the institution, the number of dependent children in the household or whether the young person has additional responsibilities that may mean they need extra help, for example, they are a young carer or a parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is for institutions to decide the process they use to assess household income, and the specific evidence they request from students/their families.  However, the Department for Education is aware that some institutions are unsure about how to use Universal Credit award notices when these are offered as evidence of household income.  The Department suggests institutions may wish to ask for the 3 most recent monthly award statements.  The take-home pay figure in addition to the amount of Universal Credit after all deductions have been made will give a total monthly income.  Using 3 months statements will act as a guide to the household income for a quarter of a year.  Institutions could then estimate assumed income for a full year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b30d9d8e5274a55be6b9bfe/Example_of_a_UC_monthly_award_notice.pdf\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--custom\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b30d9d8ed915d586822f7da/thumbnail_Example_of_a_UC_monthly_award_notice.pdf.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b30d9d8e5274a55be6b9bfe/Example_of_a_UC_monthly_award_notice.pdf\"\u003eAn example of a Universal Credit award notice\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e357 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e1 page\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe example notice shows the 2 highlighted figures – one for take-home pay; one for the amount of Universal Credit after deductions – that should be added together to give a monthly total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are encouraged to keep their bursary policies under review to ensure they continue to provide support to students who need it.  For example, students from families who are ‘just about managing’; in other words, not necessarily in receipt of free school meals or benefits but from households where parents are in lower income jobs and may struggle to provide students with all the books and equipment they need or to cover all their travel costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions that are engaged in initial extended work placement delivery are also encouraged to ensure their bursary policies are able to respond to the needs of those students who may incur extra travel costs, for example, to access their placement.

Each local authority must publish an annual transport statement that sets out the arrangements they will make to facilitate participation in education or training for students aged 16 to 19. Institutions should consider the relevant local authority’s transport statement when setting their bursary fund policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are not permitted to use the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund in any way that would give them a competitive advantage over other institutions.

This helps ensure that the bursary is spent for the reasons it was awarded. In-kind payments can include travel passes, vouchers or credits for meals, required books and required equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions make in-kind payments to students in receipt of a bursary for vulnerable groups, they should explain to the student the value of the payments and how these have been deducted from the £1,200.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are free to decide how often payments are made, taking into account the reason the bursary was awarded, the student’s circumstances and local arrangements. However, it is good practice to make regular payments (weekly, for example) as this helps students manage their finances. It also means that if a student has a payment withheld due to failing to meet the conditions the institution has set, they will not be left without financial support for a long period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions make bursary fund payments to students rather than providing support in-kind, it is good practice to pay the funding by BACS transfer to the student’s own bank account. A basic bank account (which students can open at age 16) allows BACS transfers and allows the student to withdraw money.

For example, if an institution decides a laptop or tablet is necessary for the student to complete their study programme, they can purchase this with bursary funds.  However, the student should return the equipment to the institution once they have completed their study programme so it can be re-used by another student. If keeping a laptop or tablet on campus is the best way of ensuring this happens, institutions have the right to set this as a condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"conditions-for-receiving-bursary-funding\"\u003eConditions for receiving bursary funding\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should make payments for the bursary fund - both for the bursary for vulnerable groups and the discretionary bursary - conditional on the student meeting agreed standards of attendance and behaviour.\nInstitutions should ensure that any standards they set are clear, accessible and understood by students. \nInstitutions should ensure that they obtain and retain evidence that a student has seen and agreed to the conditions.  This might be an agreement signed by the student or a signed declaration that forms part of the institution’s bursary fund application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can withhold payments if a student does not meet agreed standards, but they should always consider the individual circumstances of the student first. The independent evaluation of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund identified some students who had been sanctioned to the extent that their bursary funding had been stopped for a whole term. This is not recommended as it can stop students attending and undermine the purpose of the bursary fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should consider the impact on attendance that might be caused by illness, caring responsibilities or other exceptional circumstances. This should be built into the payment conditions agreed between the student and their institution, so that both parties are aware of the potential effect on payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should stop payments where students have been absent for a period of 4 continuous weeks or more (excluding holidays, or if there is evidence that the student intends to return) and where students have made a decision to withdraw from a study programme. Institutions can also take money back from students if they have not spent it for the reasons it was awarded to them.

This is published 3 times a year, and ensures contacts are updated about the bursary\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyoung people who might be eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups are identified by another college’s Inclusion Manager who has developed links with local agencies working with vulnerable young people (YMCA, Social Services, and Youth Offending Teams). This helps the college identify eligible young people before enrolment so they become aware of the bursary early. They are then assisted in completing the application process\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eone college employs a variety of methods to ensure eligible students are aware of the bursary. This includes promotion through partner organisations, social services, foster parent networks, schools, asylum support teams and youth offending and health services. The college works with these organisations to identify and engage with young people considering further education and to provide opportunities to discuss the support they may need\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"identifying-students-who-may-need-support-from-the-discretionary-bursary\"\u003eIdentifying students who may need support from the discretionary bursary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome institutions have informed the Department for Education that it can be difficult to identify which students may need help from the discretionary bursary if they do not pro-actively ask for support.  General further education colleges and sixth form colleges can check the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.keytosuccess.education.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eKey to Success\u003c/a\u003e site to find out if new students were in receipt of Pupil Premium funding in year 11 or received SEN support.  From September 2018, all school sixth forms, 16 to 19 academies and specialist post 16 institutions will have the same access as colleges currently do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis information should not be used to guarantee support or to offer blanket support to students, however it could be a helpful source of information for institutions to use to identify students they could proactively approach to see if financial support is required (subject to the usual assessment of individual need).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"young-people-with-caring-responsibilities\"\u003eYoung people with caring responsibilities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung people with caring responsibilities, for example, caring for a parent or other relative, may be reluctant to say so because of fear of being stigmatised. Institutions should ensure confidentiality to reduce these concerns, publicise the availability of help from the bursary fund and encourage young carers to apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen assessing young carers’ eligibility for support from the bursary, institutions could consider whether they have had a young carers assessment (which includes questions about the support they need for education), whether they access a young carers service, whether their GP could confirm their caring role or whether they receive Carers Allowance. The publication \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://professionals.carers.org/collegetoolkit\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eStudent carers in further education\u003c/a\u003e provides additional information institutions may find helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"working-with-other-organisations\"\u003eWorking with other organisations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are encouraged to work with other local institutions and the local authority to agree a common approach to the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.  This can help take account of the needs and circumstances of students in the local area. This could include institutions working together to identify and support eligible students, pool funds and centrally manage and administer the bursary.  For example, one group of colleges has created a Learning Executive with representatives from each local college. This meets regularly and sets a consistent approach to financial support across all colleges in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"managing-applications-for-the-16-to-19-bursary-fund\"\u003eManaging applications for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions delivering standard academic year provision may wish to specify that all applications for the bursary must be submitted by a specific date so they can assess the overall level of demand holistically and make discretionary awards on a fair basis. However, it is also important to bear in mind that some needs may arise later in the year. Consequently, \u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e recommends that there should be no absolute cut-off date for applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions delivering short programmes or roll-on roll-off provision should enable students to apply for help from the bursary fund at any point during the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe institution’s bursary fund statement, their bursary fund application form and any promotional materials they may use should all make clear whether there are key dates for applications they want students to meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe application process the institution puts in place must involve processes that maintain confidentiality and their application form, promotional materials etc. should emphasise this message, so students don’t feel embarrassed about applying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications and information should all be clear that students who meet the criteria for bursaries for vulnerable groups are not automatically entitled to them if they do not have financial needs and/or their financial needs are covered from other sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is best practice for students and/or their families to sign a declaration when they apply for help from the bursary to confirm that the evidence they have provided is correct and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief. Students and their families should be made aware that giving false or incomplete information that leads to incorrect/overpayment may result in future payments being stopped and any incorrectly paid funds being recovered.   They should also be informed that this might result in a referral to the police with the possibility of the student and/or their family facing prosecution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"paying-bursary-funding-to-students\"\u003ePaying bursary funding to students\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e does not expect bursary payments to be paid into another person’s account, except in exceptional circumstances where a student is unable to administer their own account. If the student is in receipt of a bursary and cannot manage their own funds, the institution will need to consider who will manage the bursary on the student’s behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should ensure students and their families know who they should contact if they have any queries about payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure that payments are made in a timely way, in other words, not too late in the year for them to help students with the costs of participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome examples of different payment approaches used by institutions are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eone institution involves carers and social workers in establishing the most appropriate way of getting the funding to the young person. At the beginning of term, if specialist equipment and/or a travel pass is needed, the college purchases this and the cost is deducted from the student’s overall award. The remainder is paid to the student in regular instalments. In cases where a carer has responsibility for the young person’s finances, meetings are set up with them to decide how payments should be made\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein another institution, every student who qualifies for a bursary for vulnerable groups is offered an interview with a financial support advisor to decide together on the best way to deliver his or her support. Priority areas are addressed first; travel to college, equipment costs and support with studies. Additional expenditure such as university visits is also discussed, and where money remains, an amount is retained for unforeseen costs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eone institution pays students a greater amount of funding at the start of their course so students can pay for equipment and course-related items. Travel vouchers are used to pay for bus fares. The Student Services Team meet with the students regularly to help them with budgeting. A percentage of the total bursary funding is kept back as a hardship fund to respond to emergencies that may arise later in the year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-ask-a-question-about-the-16-to-19-bursary-fund\"\u003eHow to ask a question about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf institutions have a question that is not answered by this guide, please contact \u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e via our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/fillform.php?self=1\u0026amp;form_id=HR41uA2F8Dh\u0026amp;type=form\u0026amp;ShowMsg=1\u0026amp;form_name=Knowledge+centre+enquiry+form\u0026amp;noRegister=false\u0026amp;ret=%2Fmodule%2Fservices\u0026amp;noLoginPrompt=1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eonline enquiry form\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions with any questions about completion of the bursary for vulnerable groups funding claim or about bursary for vulnerable groups payments made by the SBSS should contact SBSS on 0300 303 8610 or at: \u003ca href=\"mailto:1619bursary@studentbursarysupport.co.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e1619bursary@studentbursarysupport.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

Can I use the UKCA mark on AVCP system 3 products tested by an EU notified body for the purpose of CE marking where this testing was done before 1 January 2023?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn June 2022, the government announced an intention to allow manufacturers of construction products under AVCP system 3, whose products are tested by an EU notified body before 1 January 2023, to obtain a UKCA mark without having to retest through a UK-approved body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis measure was related to the intention at that time to end recognition of CE marking for construction products on 31 December 2022, and was subject to legislation. Following the extension of CE marking recognition for construction products until 30 June 2025, the government will not introduce the legislation to bring in these measures. Therefore it remains that UKCA marking should only be affixed to products tested by a UK approved body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn recognition that legislation has not been introduced to cover this issue, and until further notice, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) will not take enforcement action against any economic actor solely where the UKCA mark has been used on construction products tested by an EU recognised notified body for the purpose of CE marking, where this testing was done before 31 December 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOPSS takes all enforcement decisions on the basis of its \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-and-standards-enforcement-enforcement-policy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eenforcement policy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

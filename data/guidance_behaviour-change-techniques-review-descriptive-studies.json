To evaluate this, you need to know what your product does that aims to change behaviour – that is, the behaviour change techniques it uses. A behaviour change techniques (\u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e) review uses established classifications of \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e to review behaviour change products or interventions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/evidence-standards-framework-for-digital-health-technologies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e(\u003cabbr title=\"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\"\u003eNICE\u003c/abbr\u003e) evidence standards framework for digital health technologies (tier C products)\u003c/a\u003e recommends describing the functions of your product using appropriate \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BCTTv1_PDF_version.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change technique\"\u003eBCT\u003c/abbr\u003e Taxonomy (v1) (PDF)\u003c/a\u003e is one classification system of established \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use a \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e review at any stage of the development of your digital product or service.

The \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change technique\"\u003eBCT\u003c/abbr\u003e is the part of the intervention that aims to change behaviour. For example, awarding medals, badges and points in apps would be categorised as the \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change technique\"\u003eBCT\u003c/abbr\u003e related to incentives and rewards in the group ‘Reward and threat’. \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e can be used alone or in combination with others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s say you are developing a digital service to help people achieve work-life balance. You would like to know what other digital products exist that aim to help users establish work-life balance routines and what \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e they have used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, decide what sample of the interventions will be assessed in your review. This depends on what types of digital products or services you are interested in. You could either review all products or take a sample of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e review aims to describe the content of these products by quantifying the techniques used. This means that for every product in your sample, you would indicate which \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e are present or absent. Ideally, you should download the product and try to use it to help you accurately describe the \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e it uses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also a good idea to have a second reviewer, acting independently of the first reviewer. This makes the review more objective and systematic, and the results are more accurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe results of this review will help you to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esee what the most commonly-used \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e are\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eidentify where the gaps may be\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethink about how you could include some of the techniques in your product\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf most products are using a particular technique, that may suggest it is effective and you might want to make sure your product uses it too. If no products are using a particular technique that seems to fit your context, that might also suggest a gap in the market you could fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also use \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e to describe the content of digital interventions that you are developing or have developed. This will help you to describe how your product might support the user to make changes to bring about positive health outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e in your \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/define-how-your-product-works-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003emodel of how your product works\u003c/a\u003e.

They found that certain \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e appeared frequently, while others were rare or non-existent. For example, most of the apps provided monitoring and feedback on behaviour, such as automatic monitoring of speed, and distance and pace in running apps. However, other \u003cabbr title=\"behaviour change techniques\"\u003eBCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e weren’t present in any apps, such as building a sense of identity that is aligned with healthy behaviour and helping users to reflect on any problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis review and content analysis enabled the researchers to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efind out what the most popular apps on the market do to help users to change behaviour\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eidentify gaps\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erecommend some improvements for future technology development for physical activity\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis scientific paper describes how the taxonomy was developed: Michie and others (2013): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-013-9486-6\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy (v1) of 93 Hierarchically Clustered Techniques: Building an International Consensus for the Reporting of Behavior Change Interventions\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/clinical-educational-and-health-psychology/research-groups/behaviour-change-techniques-and\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThis website includes more resources relating to the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy, including online training\u003c/a\u003e.

Overview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness Improvement Districts are business led partnerships which are created through a ballot process to deliver additional services to local businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey can be a powerful tool for directly involving local businesses in local activities and allow the business community and local authorities to work together to improve the local trading environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-business-improvement-district\"\u003e2. What is a Business Improvement District?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA Business Improvement District is a defined area in which a levy is charged on all eligible business rate payers in addition to the business rates bill. This levy is used to develop projects which will benefit businesses in the local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no limit on what projects or services can be provided through a Business Improvement District. The only requirement is that it should be something that is in addition to services provided by local authorities. Improvements may include, but are not limited to, extra safety/security, cleansing and environmental measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, a Business Improvement District is within a local authority boundary but in April 2013 government introduced Cross Boundary Business Improvement Districts enabling Business Improvement Districts to operate across local authority boundaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-is-a-business-improvement-district-established\"\u003e3. How is a Business Improvement District established?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA Business Improvement District can be set up by the local authority, a business rate payer or a person or company whose purpose is to develop the Business Improvement District area, or that has an interest in the land in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-business-improvement-district-proposer\"\u003eThe Business Improvement District proposer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Business Improvement District proposer is required to develop a proposal and submit this to the local authority, along with a business plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe proposal should set out the services to be provided and the size and scope of the Business Improvement District. It will also set out who is liable for the levy, the amount of levy to be collected and how it is calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt least 84 days before submitting proposals, the ballot proposer should notify the local authority and the Secretary of State of their intention to put the BID proposal to ballot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt least 42 days before the final ballot date, the ballot holder should publish a notice stating the date of the ballot, and send a copy of this to the Secretary of State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese notices should be sent to the Secretary of State at \u003ca href=\"mailto:NDR@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNDR@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e or via post to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"address\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"adr org fn\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThe Secretary of State \n\u003cbr\u003ec/o Local Taxation Division\n\u003cbr\u003eMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\n\u003cbr\u003e2nd Floor, Fry Building\n\u003cbr\u003e2 Marsham Street\n\u003cbr\u003eLondon, SW1P 4DF\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-ballot\"\u003eThe ballot\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBusinesses that are subject to the levy, as set out in the proposals, vote in a ballot. This determines whether the scheme goes ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA successful vote is one that has a simple majority both in votes cast and in rateable value of votes cast. Each business entitled to vote in a Business Improvement District ballot is allowed one vote in respect of each property occupied or (if unoccupied) owned by them in the geographical area of the Business Improvement District.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the Business Improvement District is in operation the levy is charged on all businesses within the Business Improvement District area (regardless of whether or how that business voted in the ballot).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee further \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-improvement-districts-guidance-and-best-practice\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on how to establish a Business Improvement District\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-local-authority\"\u003eThe local authority\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local authority will manage the ballot process.

Who pays the levy?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Business Improvement District proposal must set out who is liable for the levy, the amount of levy to be collected and how it is calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe proposal should also provide details of any \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-business-rate-relief\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003erelief from the Business Improvement District levy\u003c/a\u003e that may apply and who is eligible. The amount and type of relief is dependent on local circumstances but could typically include charity relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually Business Improvement Districts charge a levy rate of between 1% and 4% of rateable value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this is dependent on local circumstances and there is also an increasing number of Business Improvement Districts that charge using a banded system. (Businesses are grouped together according to their rateable value. The levy charged will be a percentage of this rateable value.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-long-will-a-business-improvement-district-last\"\u003e5.

This is often a private company but can be a partnership with the local authority. Most Business Improvement District bodies are not-for-profit companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Business Improvement District body is responsible for developing and implementing the proposal which sets out how the Business Improvement District will operate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will provide the local authority with this proposal along with the business plan (including the estimated cash flow and predicted revenue to be generated by the Business Improvement District) along with the financial management arrangements for the Business Improvement District body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local authority will manage billing and the collection of the levy and will hold the levy in a ring-fenced revenue account on behalf of the Business Improvement District body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appeals\"\u003e7.

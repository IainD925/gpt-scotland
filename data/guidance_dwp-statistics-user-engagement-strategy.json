This role is a continuation of the proposition in the \u003cabbr title=\"Government Statistical Service\"\u003eGSS\u003c/abbr\u003e user engagement strategy, which assigned a user engagement champion to each department.

This can help us to infer user behaviour patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"strand-2-developing-our-statistics\"\u003eStrand 2: Developing our statistics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis strand illustrates how the insights gained from research will be used to better our statistics. Developments will be undertaken whilst seeking to balance conflicting user interests – importantly they will be led by user research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOpportunities for development may be more overarching and strategic – for example, remedying a data presentational element on Stat-Xplore. Alternatively, they may be more targeted and specific, such as improving user guidance for submitting data requests on a specific statistical publication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ‘Developing our statistics’ strand is also responsible for ensuring that user engagement progresses. This may be done by driving forward developments such as embedding regular communications (such as mailing lists or page alerts) to keep users updated of planned developments and to promote statistics more widely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"strand-3-monitoring-our-progress\"\u003eStrand 3: Monitoring our progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis strand involves considering the performance of our statistics, using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. An example of a quantitative performance indicator is how many web page visits our statistical publications acquire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, quantitative metrics are limited in their detail as well as ‘telling the whole story’. For example, having a large number of hits is not a measure of quality or success – while it tells us reach, it doesn’t tell us how well a publication meets needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed, using qualitative metrics in tandem with quantitative. An example qualitative performance indicator is improved user feedback via email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan is cyclical in nature, with research to be repeated every 3 years. The ‘Developing our statistics’ and ‘Monitoring our progress’ strands are ongoing, but will likely see their most active periods cyclically following completion of user research. See the diagram below for an illustration of this cyclical process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/120018/ue-strategy-1__002__external_image.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKey actors will be user engagement champions, leading on the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e statistics survey, ‘Quantitative user research’ and ‘Monitoring our progress’ strands.

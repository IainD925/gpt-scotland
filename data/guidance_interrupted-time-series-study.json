This means introducing and withdrawing your digital product or service, or some part of it, and then seeing if anything changes in the outcome you’re assessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing \u003cabbr title=\"Interrupted time series\"\u003eITS\u003c/abbr\u003e can help you to find out whether your digital product or service achieves its aims, so it can be useful to conduct once you have developed your product (summative evaluation).

For example, \u003cabbr title=\"Interrupted time series\"\u003eITS\u003c/abbr\u003e studies let us assess the impact of introducing smoke-free policies by comparing the data before and after the introduction of the policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, \u003cabbr title=\"Interrupted time series\"\u003eITS\u003c/abbr\u003e can also be very useful for evaluating digital health products. For example, you could use \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ecological-momentary-assessment\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eecological momentary assessment\u003c/a\u003e to collect your data. There are 2 main types of designs that are useful for assessing products delivered through digital means:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"aba-design-also-called-reversal-or-removal-design\"\u003eABA design (also called reversal or removal design)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn an ABA design, outcomes are collected consistently but the intervention is added and then removed. The continuous data collection lets you assess if the outcome changes when the intervention is added and whether the effect diminishes after it is removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis design is only appropriate if the digital product or service aims to produce an effect and the effect is expected to diminish when the product is withdrawn (\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/crossover-randomised-controlled-trial-comparative-studies#how-to-carry-out-a-crossover-rct\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esee carry-over effects in crossover randomised controlled trials\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"multiple-baseline-design\"\u003eMultiple baseline design\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a multiple baseline design, the start of the intervention is staggered across participants. This design is particularly useful if you cannot remove the digital product after introducing it or if the effects of the intervention cannot be unlearned. For example, it is useful when you are progressively rolling out a new digital service to different organisations. You can measure the outcome before and after the introduction of the service in different places at different times. You can then compare the change over time accounting for any factors that may influence the effects, such as events that impact all organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"analysing-its-data\"\u003eAnalysing \u003cabbr title=\"Interrupted time series\"\u003eITS\u003c/abbr\u003e data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnalysis of an \u003cabbr title=\"Interrupted time series\"\u003eITS\u003c/abbr\u003e series considers the underlying trends and patterns across the full dataset when estimating intervention effects.

At the end of the intervention phase, participants were asked to stop posting videos (and earning vouchers) but to continue blood glucose testing. For both A-phases, data was collected from the participant’s personal glucometer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe authors reported:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean increase in the frequency of blood glucose tests when incentives were introduced\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea reduction when the incentives were removed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some carry-over effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs this was a feasibility study with a small sample, the authors did not draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of the incentives.

To avoid duplication, we will not consider proposals that could be funded by existing \u003cabbr title=\"Nature for Climate Fund\"\u003eNCF\u003c/abbr\u003e grants and incentives. We would expect any successful proposals to be largely capital (capital departmental expenditure limits - \u003cabbr title=\"capital departmental expenditure limits\"\u003eCDEL\u003c/abbr\u003e) based. A small allowance for enabling revenue costs (revenue departmental expenditure limits - \u003cabbr title=\"revenue departmental expenditure limits\"\u003eRDEL\u003c/abbr\u003e) would be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecommendations from the assessment panel will be taken to the June \u003cabbr title=\"Nature for Climate Fund\"\u003eNCF\u003c/abbr\u003e Programme Board for due consideration. If suitable new ideas are forthcoming, and approved by the Board, we will then develop a business case and identify the appropriate route to market with DEFRA group Commercial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"for-further-information\"\u003eFor further information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther information is available on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.find-government-grants.service.gov.uk/grants/nature-for-climate-fund-call-for-ideas-1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eapplication page\u003c/a\u003e or by contacting the Forestry Commission at \u003ca href=\"mailto:callforideas@forestrycommission.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecallforideas@forestrycommission.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e and by attending the webinar:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday 19 Apr 2023\n10:00 - 11:00am\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/call-for-ideas-webinar-tickets-602218911977\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBook your place via Eventbrite\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"disclaimer\"\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDEFRA and the Forestry Commission reserves the right not to take forward any proposals for further consideration if no suitable ideas are forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

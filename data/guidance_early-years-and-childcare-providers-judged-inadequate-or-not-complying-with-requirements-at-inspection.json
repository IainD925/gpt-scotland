It will give the date by which you must comply with the requirements in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘Statutory framework for the early years foundation stage (\u003cabbr title=\"early years foundation stage\"\u003eEYFS\u003c/abbr\u003e)’\u003c/a\u003e that you failed to meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we may decide to take enforcement action against you and issue a welfare requirements notice (\u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e) because you have failed to meet one or more of the safeguarding and welfare requirements of the \u003cabbr title=\"early years foundation stage\"\u003eEYFS\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be an offence not to take the steps that we require of you in a \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e. We also have a range of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-and-childcare-ofsteds-enforcement-policy/early-years-and-childcare-enforcement-policy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eother enforcement action\u003c/a\u003e that we can take, including cancelling your registration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe inspector will have explained the weaknesses that have led to the judgement of inadequate. They will also have discussed with you what you need to do to improve. If the inspector determines that enforcement action is needed, they will have explained what action we can take and what this means. You will need to be able to provide evidence that you are meeting the requirements for ongoing registration the next time that we visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"visit-to-check-compliance--regulatory-visit-or-a-reinspection\"\u003eVisit to check compliance – regulatory visit or a reinspection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we decide to take enforcement action and we allow the provision to continue to operate, we will monitor your progress in meeting the \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe may also carry out a regulatory visit to check what actions you have taken. Alternatively, we may decide to proceed straight to the reinspection. This will depend on the date the actions are due to be completed and the seriousness of the actions covered in the \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will re-inspect you within 6 months of the inspection at which you were judged inadequate. This will happen regardless of whether we carry out a separate regulatory visit following a \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we decide to check compliance through a regulatory visit, we will ask you to tell us what you have done to put things right. We will check that the improvements you have made are compliant with the \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e. If we agree that the action you have taken is sufficient, the next step will be another inspection within 6 months of the original inspection date.

Failure to meet a \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e is an offence according to \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/938/regulation/12/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRegulation 12 of The Early Years Foundation Stage (Welfare Requirements) Regulations 2012\u003c/a\u003e. This may lead to the cancellation of your registration. If we find that you have addressed the actions set out in the \u003cabbr title=\"welfare requirements notice\"\u003eWRN\u003c/abbr\u003e but are breaching other requirements, we may take further enforcement action.

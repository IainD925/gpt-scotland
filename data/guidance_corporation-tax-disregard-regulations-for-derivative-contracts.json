They will therefore need to consider whether to elect in to regulations 7, 8 or 9 of the Disregard Regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is particularly relevant for companies which previously applied Old Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u003cabbr title=\"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\"\u003eGAAP\u003c/abbr\u003e) excluding Financial Reporting Standard (\u003cabbr title=\"Financial Reporting Standard\"\u003eFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e) 26.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many cases the deadline for making an election is 6 months from the start of the first relevant accounting period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Disregard Regulations only apply for the purposes of Corporation Tax. They do not apply to individuals (and other entities) within the charge to Income Tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"accounting-standards\"\u003eAccounting standards\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe accounting standards used to prepare financial statements changed on 1 January 2015 and many companies will need to apply one of the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEU-endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (\u003cabbr title=\"International Financial Reporting Standards\"\u003eIFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"Financial Reporting Standard\"\u003eFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e 101\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"Financial Reporting Standard\"\u003eFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e 102\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, from 1 January 2016 the Financial Reporting Standard for Small Entities (\u003cabbr title=\"Finance Reporting Standard for Small Entities\"\u003eFRSSE\u003c/abbr\u003e) is being withdrawn.  As a result many small companies will also be applying the requirements of section 1A of \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Reporting Standard\"\u003eFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e 102 from 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accounting-standards-the-uk-tax-implications-of-new-uk-gaap\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eaccounting standards: the UK tax implications of new UK \u003cabbr title=\"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\"\u003eGAAP\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for details of the key accounting changes and tax considerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"hedging-corporation-tax-treatment\"\u003eHedging: Corporation Tax treatment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are essentially 2 options governing how hedging relationships are treated for Corporation Tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"following-amounts-in-profit-or-loss\"\u003eFollowing amounts in profit or loss\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe default option is an approach which simply follows the amounts recognised through profit or loss in most cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"computational-provisions-to-restore-old-uk-gaap\"\u003eComputational provisions to restore Old UK \u003cabbr title=\"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\"\u003eGAAP\u003c/abbr\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alternative option is to apply the detailed computational provisions laid out in regulations 7, 8 and 9 of the Disregard Regulations (SI 2004/3256). These largely operate to restore the treatment that would have arisen under Old UK \u003cabbr title=\"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\"\u003eGAAP\u003c/abbr\u003e (where \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Reporting Standard\"\u003eFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e 26 does not apply).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor periods of account starting on or after 1 January 2015, companies must elect in to regulations 7, 8 and 9 rather than the previous elect out approach. Companies which applied fair value accounting in earlier periods will continue with the same treatment without having to make new elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are strict time limits for the election, which must be made by the later of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e6 months from the start of the accounting period where fair value accounting first applies\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e6 months from the first relevant contract being entered into\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e12 months from the end of the accounting period for non-large companies - a company is large if it is a qualifying company for the Senior Accounting Officer rules, see \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/10/schedule/45\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eschedule 45 FA 2009\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-a-company-might-elect-in-to-regulations-7-8-and-9\"\u003eWhen a company might elect in to regulations 7, 8 and 9\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies affected by the changes to accounting standards need to consider whether to make an election under the Disregard Regulations. They should take advice on this as appropriate, as they would normally when preparing their Corporation Tax computations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn election can specify which of regulations 7, 8 and 9 apply to the company’s derivative contracts. Where this is not specified, the election will apply all 3 regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBelow is some general guidance for companies that have not previously had to consider the impact of the Disregard Regulations. This does not constitute advice on the approach a company should take - which will depend on its own particular circumstances. The Disregard Regulations contain anti-avoidance rules to prevent manipulation of the rules in this area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"designated-hedging-relationship\"\u003eDesignated hedging relationship\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA company may adopt an approach where it designates hedging relationships for accounting purposes and not to elect in to regulations 7, 8 and 9 of the Disregard Regulations.  Generally in this case, the tax treatment will simply follow the amounts recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to a cash flow hedging reserve are disregarded under regulation 9A. This approach may be appropriate for companies which use hedge accounting and have effective hedges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder this approach the company will typically be taxed on any fair value movements recognised in profit or loss, for example relating to any undesignated hedges or any hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the profit or loss account. This approach therefore may not be appropriate where the company is not able to, or chooses not to, designate hedging relationships for accounting purposes, or where its hedging relationships have a significant amount of hedge ineffectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"elect-in-to-regulations-7-8-and-9-of-the-disregard-regulations\"\u003eElect in to regulations 7, 8 and 9 of the Disregard Regulations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively a company may decide to elect in to regulations 7, 8 and 9. These regulations override the accounts and broadly operate to restore the Old UK \u003cabbr title=\"Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\"\u003eGAAP\u003c/abbr\u003e treatment (where \u003cabbr title=\"Financial Reporting Standard\"\u003eFRS\u003c/abbr\u003e 26 does not apply). Adjustments will be needed in the company’s Corporation Tax computation. The effect in most cases will be to remove fair value volatility where the derivative is part of a hedging relationship. This approach may be appropriate for companies which cannot use, or do not wish to use, hedge accounting or for companies where there is significant hedge ineffectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"no-designated-hedges-and-no-election-made\"\u003eNo designated hedges and no election made\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore unusually, some companies may adopt an approach of neither designating hedging relationships nor making an election in to regulations 7, 8 and 9. In this case, the tax treatment will follow the amounts recognised in profit or loss, which is likely to mean the company will be subject to tax on fair value volatility in the accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an overview of how hedging works see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporation-tax-hedging-derivative-contracts-and-disregard-regulations\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCorporation Tax: derivative contracts, hedging and Disregard Regulations\u003c/a\u003e guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporation-tax-hedging-arrangement-examples\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCorporation Tax: hedging arrangement examples\u003c/a\u003e which explain Corporation Tax treatment for common hedging arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find more detailed information on derivative contracts, hedge accounting and the application of the Disregard Regulations in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cfmmanual/index.htm\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCorporate Finance Manual\u003c/a\u003e.

But the supply of accommodation does not become exempt from VAT, it is still taxable and the normal input tax rules apply. As such, the reduced value rule operates differently from the temporary reduced rate for VAT as it operates to relieve part of the charge for the supply from VAT as opposed to reducing the rate of VAT charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"para32\"\u003e3.2 How the reduced value rule works\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to establish that you’re providing accommodation in a hotel, inn, boarding house or similar establishment. The reduced value rule does not apply to holiday accommodation, read sections 5 and 6 of this guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a guest stays in your establishment for a continuous period of more than 28 days, then from the 29th day of the stay you should charge VAT only on that part of the payment that is not for accommodation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you make an inclusive charge for bed and board you must apportion it reasonably and charge VAT on the full amount that is not for the accommodation. When you do this, you must calculate the amount of your charge that is for meals, drinks and other services, and also treat at least 20% of the remainder as being for facilities. But if the true value of the facilities is more than this, you must charge VAT on the true amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe examples in section 8 of this guidance show you how to work out the reduced value of your supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"para33\"\u003e3.3 Individuals who are eligible for the reduced value rule\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reduced value rule applies to individuals who stay with you for more than 28 days in a hotel, inn or any similar establishment (either alone, or together with one or more other individuals who stay otherwise than at their own expense).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rule does not apply to bookings by companies where the accommodation is used by a succession of short-term occupants, and each stay is less than 29 days at a time. For example, it does not apply where airlines make block bookings of hotel accommodation for crew stopovers. But where the supply is made to someone other than the individual who will be using the accommodation, but the stay by the individual is for more than 28 days, then the rule will apply. This often occurs where the supply of accommodation for homeless people is made to a local authority. In such cases the reduced value applies from the 29th day of each individual’s stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA guest’s stay must be continuous to qualify for the reduced value rule. For example, if a guest stays for 3 weeks every month, you must always charge them VAT in full. If another guest stays for 5 weeks, leaves for a week, and returns to stay for 5 more weeks, the reduced value rule applies only to the fifth week of each separate stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut a guest’s departure is not seen to end their stay provided the guest either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis a long-term resident and leaves for an occasional weekend or holiday\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis a student who leaves during the vacation but returns to the same accommodation for the following term\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epays a retaining fee\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn these cases, the time away is ignored and you only have to charge VAT (whether temporarily at the reduced rate or at the standard rate outside the temporary period) in full for the first 28 days of the overall stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not matter whether the guest returns to the same room or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor examples of how to calculate the reduced VAT value for accommodation exceeding 28 days (read section 8 of this guidance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"para41\"\u003e4.

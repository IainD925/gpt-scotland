We have been conducting statutory \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspections since 2003, and any UK \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e or marketing authorisation applicant (for any authorisation procedure) can be subject to \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspection by \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e, which may also include any of their partners or service providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf pharmacovigilance activities are performed outside the UK, the \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e may ask company personnel from other country sites to participate in an inspection at a UK site and/or may liaise with inspectorates in other regulatory agencies to perform an inspection at site(s) in their country or to share results from recent inspections, where confidentiality agreements are in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-inspection\"\u003eTypes of inspection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspections are typically scheduled by pharmacovigilance system, product or post-authorisation safety study, rather  than by \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e.

Conversely, if an \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e operates more than one pharmacovigilance system, we usually review these through separate inspections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"routine-national-inspections\"\u003eRoutine national inspections\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspections are scheduled as part of the \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e’s national inspection programme according to a risk-based approach, largely founded on the risk factors listed in EU statutory guidance (Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) Module III), as modified by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptions-and-modifications-to-the-eu-guidance-on-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-that-will-apply-to-uk-mahs-and-the-mhra\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eExceptions and modifications to EU guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices that apply to UK MAHs and the licensing authority\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e is usually notified of these inspections in advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor inspections that cover products authorised in respect of Northern Ireland, our \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspectorate shares the list of planned and conducted UK national inspections with the EMA and this is made available to all Eu Member States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an inspection results in a critical finding it is likely the \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e will be subject to a triggered re-inspection within 12 to 18 months, with a focus on the actions that were agreed following the last inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf no critical findings are identified there is no specific timeline by which an \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e must be inspected again. The frequency of inspection will be decided using the risk-based approach, and an inspection may be performed at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 2016, we no longer require routine \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e compliance reports to be submitted by MAHs, which were previously used to inform our risk-based inspection programme, as we now have access to a variety of information sources that can support our scheduling and planning activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, an organisation may be specifically requested to provide information relating to their authorisations and pharmacovigilance systems. Should this information be required, the \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e will be contacted directly by the \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e Inspectorate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"triggered-inspections\"\u003eTriggered inspections\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e may perform a triggered inspection of an \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e in response to receiving specific risk information.

However, there are scenarios where pre-authorisation \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspections of applicants for marketing authorisations are warranted and the objective of these inspections is to assess whether the applicant has the ability to comply with post-authorisation pharmacovigilance obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"service-provider-inspections\"\u003eService Provider inspections\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasingly, MAHs are outsourcing all or some of their pharmacovigilance activities to contract service providers; such activities conducted by these organisations on behalf of MAHs are subject to supervision by \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e, including by means of inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a pilot programme of stand-alone service provider inspections, we concluded that a routine programme of inspections of pharmacovigilance service providers is not currently viable for the \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspectorate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe continue to assess the activities performed by service providers in the context of \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e inspections. We may conduct stand-alone inspections of these organisations where it is deemed necessary to evaluate the overall system and procedures implemented by a service provider based on risk information available to the \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContracts with pharmacovigilance service providers should include provisions that cover the availability of data, documentation and appropriate support to the \u003cabbr title=\"Marketing Authorisation Holder\"\u003eMAH\u003c/abbr\u003e and inspectors during a \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"working-with-other-regulators\"\u003eWorking with other regulators\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e \u003cabbr title=\"Good pharmacovigilance practice\"\u003eGPvP\u003c/abbr\u003e inspection reports that cover products authorised in respect of Northern Ireland are shared with the EMA and EU/European Economic Area (EEA) Member States.

As part of the inspection notification, the pharmacovigilance system master file (\u003cabbr title=\"Pharmacovigilance system master file\"\u003ePSMF\u003c/abbr\u003e) will be requested.

In addition to the \u003cabbr title=\"Pharmacovigilance system master file\"\u003ePSMF\u003c/abbr\u003e, inspectors may require supplementary information to confirm the scope of the inspection and to be well prepared.

This statutory framework is referred to as ‘biodiversity net gain’ in Planning Practice Guidance to distinguish it from other or more general biodiversity gains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the statutory framework for biodiversity net gain, \u003ca href=\"#para3\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esubject to some exceptions\u003c/a\u003e, every grant of planning permission is deemed to have been granted subject to the condition that the biodiversity gain objective is met (“the biodiversity gain condition”). This objective is for development to deliver at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value relative to the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat. This increase can be achieved through onsite biodiversity gains, registered offsite biodiversity gains or statutory biodiversity credits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biodiversity gain condition is a pre-commencement condition: once planning permission has been granted, a Biodiversity Gain Plan must be submitted and approved by the planning authority before commencement of the development. There are exemptions and transitional arrangements which disapply the condition from certain planning permissions, as well as special modifications for planning permissions for phased development and the treatment of irreplaceable habitats. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe statutory framework for biodiversity net gain also includes provisions about information requirements for planning applications and the treatment of the condition on decision notices on the grant of planning permission. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe relevant primary legislation for the statutory framework for biodiversity net gain is principally set out under \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/30/schedule/14/enacted\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSchedule 7A (Biodiversity Gain in England) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990\u003c/a\u003e.

Once planning permission has been granted, unless exempt, a Biodiversity Gain Plan must be submitted and approved prior to the commencement of that development. This Plan is the mechanism to ensure that the biodiversity gain objective is met and in particular:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe post-development biodiversity value of the development’s onsite habitat is accurate based on the approved plans and drawings for the development;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany offsite biodiversity gains have been registered and allocated to the development; and\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebiodiversity credits, if they are necessary for the development, have been purchased.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBiodiversity net gain, however, is not just a post-permission matter. To ensure the biodiversity gain objective is met and the condition can be discharged successfully, it is important biodiversity net gain is considered throughout the planning process. The National Planning Policy Framework emphasises that plans should identify and pursue opportunities for securing measurable net gains for biodiversity, and plans and decisions should minimise impacts and provide net gains for biodiversity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, prior to the submission of a relevant planning application, applicants are encouraged to consider biodiversity net gain early in the development process and factor it into site selection and design. Where appropriate, they should discuss the biodiversity net gain requirements for their development upfront with the relevant local planning authority utilising any pre-application advice services offered by them. This could help establish whether development proposals would be subject to biodiversity net gain and, if they are, enable feedback on the proposed strategy for achieving the biodiversity gain objective and consideration of the Biodiversity Gain Hierarchy to inform the design of the proposals. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a planning application is submitted for development which the applicant believes is subject to the biodiversity gain condition, there are \u003ca href=\"#para11\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eminimum national information requirements\u003c/a\u003e related to biodiversity net gain which the applicant must provide. These requirements will allow consideration of existing habitat baselines for relevant applications so there is a common understanding about the pre-development biodiversity value of the development’s onsite habitat at this stage. Local planning authorities may also seek further information, where it is appropriate to do so, about the proposed approach to meeting the biodiversity gain objective for the development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen determining a planning application, biodiversity net gain will often be a material consideration, and local planning authorities will want to consider, where relevant, whether the biodiversity gain condition is capable of being discharged successfully through the imposition of conditions and agreement of section 106 planning obligations to secure significant onsite biodiversity gains and registered offsite biodiversity gains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, following the approval of the Biodiversity Gain Plan and commencement of development, there will be an important role for local planning authorities to monitor the implementation of biodiversity net gain Plan and, where appropriate, take enforcement action if commitments relating to the Plan are not met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 002 Reference ID: 74-002-20240214\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"para3\"\u003eWhich planning permissions are in scope and which are exempt from biodiversity net gain?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile every grant of planning permission in England is deemed to have been granted subject to the biodiversity gain condition, commencement and transitional arrangements, as well as exemptions, mean that certain permissions are not subject to biodiversity net gain. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBiodiversity net gain has only been commenced for planning permissions granted in respect to an application made on or after 12 February 2024.

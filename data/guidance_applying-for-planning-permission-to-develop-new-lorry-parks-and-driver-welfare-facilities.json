Local planning authorities are responsible for processing and ultimately determining your application based on policies in their development plan and the evidence you provide. In 2-tier council areas (where you have a County Council and a District Council) the relevant local planning authority is part of the District Council. However, you can always check who your local planning authority is via the GOV.UK website\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, a case officer will be assigned to handle and assess your application. They are your main point of contact within the local planning authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, planning consultants have specialist knowledge and will be able to help you iron out the finer details of your planning application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also local people, this might include local councillors who sit on the planning committee. It’s important to engage with local people to get a feel of what is important at ground level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we have statutory consultees. These are organisations or bodies which local planning authorities are legally required to consult with before making a decision on a planning application. This can include bodies like National Highways and the Environment Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we have the local highways authority. They are the body responsible for the maintenance of public roads and the safety and free flow of traffic. They are consulted on any planning applications that impact the local highways network. In 2-tier council areas they sit at the county level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-makes-a-good-planning-application\"\u003eWhat makes a good planning application?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, now let’s consider the ingredients that make up a successful planning application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you begin, you should consider whether you or your organisation have the skills, experience and expertise needed to fully engage with the planning process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou shouldn’t underestimate the value that can be added to the planning process by working with the right people with the right skills who can manage the process for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, you might want to consider using a planning consultancy or other specialist professionals to help with your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarly engagement with these consultancies is key to making sure the planning process runs smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rtpi.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRoyal Town Planning Institute\u003c/a\u003e has a \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rtpiconsultants.co.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edirectory of planning consultants\u003c/a\u003e which you may find helpful in selecting a consultant that meets your needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure you only engage with a consultant who you are confident has the right knowledge and a proven track record of delivering successful applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat matters most is having the relevant experience and access to specialist advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"planning-issues\"\u003ePlanning issues\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, it is important to say that successfully engaging with the planning process doesn’t just start when you submit your planning application and pay the fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should be thinking about planning issues and their potential solutions at the earliest possible stages of your development – and this can even be at the point you select a site to develop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking about possible sites to develop, it is essential that you consider any, and all, site constraints that may have an impact on a future application, this can include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany site contamination\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecurrent or previous uses of the site\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elocal planning controls and any relevant development plan policies – for example, is the site in the green belt?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou should also consider the site’s planning history\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany historic or environmental protections – for example are there any listed buildings or protected trees?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou will also need to consider current access arrangements to the site – is it directly accessible, or does it require access over third party land?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCarrying out these checks can also highlight if you need any additional expertise to support your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to check the development plan for the area and familiarise yourself with relevant planning policies that may be material to your application. This is essential, as planning law requires decisions on planning applications must be taken in accordance with the development plan unless there are material considerations that indicate otherwise. Developments that run contrary to the development plan carry a higher risk of refusal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"pre-application-planning\"\u003ePre-application planning\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere possible, engage with the local planning authority early. This can greatly assist in helping you assess site constraints or other issues that might affect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you cannot directly engage with planning officers, local planning authority websites have a wealth of information that can help you to identify the right sites for development that have the best chances of securing planning permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe success of many development proposals relies on thorough and positive collaboration with your local planning authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarly engagement is essential and the path to planning permission starts with good pre-application advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is never too early to touch base with the local planning authority and keeping in regular contact is advised as you’re unlikely to get all the information you need in one letter, email or meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a number of ways you can engage with the local planning authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis can range from informal contact via correspondence, or in-person meetings as you begin to develop your application through to more formal channels like applying for pre-application advice when your application is at a more mature stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome local planning authorities charge for their pre-application advice, so always check what pre-application services they offer and factor any costs and time into your development programme. The feedback you receive from them will be critical in helping you through the planning process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt may also prompt a process of engagement with communities and other bodies to resolve local issues as part of the design process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also want to consider talking with other statutory bodies like National Highways or the Environment Agency – there might be other site constraints affecting the site that these bodies need to examine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"application-documents\"\u003eApplication documents\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you prepare to submit your application, it is essential that you gather together all of the information you need to support it. You (or your consultant) will need to check with the local planning authority for a full list of information required. This will certainly include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecompleted application forms\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epayment of the correct fee\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eplans and drawings\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eownership certificate and agricultural land declaration\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea design and access statement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there may be specific requirements in relation to applications that are subject to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eenvironmental impact assessments\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etree or ecological surveys\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etransport assessments\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eand flood risk assessments\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as well as these documents, planning authorities may have their own local information requirements which are often listed in a local validation list, which should be available online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA local validation list will inform you of exactly what documents and information you will need to supply to the local planning authority so that your application can be registered and determined within the statutory time limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"submitting-your-application\"\u003eSubmitting your application\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you are satisfied you have all of the information and documents you need, you are then ready to submit your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications are typically submitted online with electronic versions of all your documents. However, in certain circumstances you may be required to provide physical copies as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA planning fee is payable when you submit your application. The fee for different types of applications is set nationally according to regulation. A schedule of fees can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning-practice-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eplanning practice guidance on GOV.UK\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce your application has been checked by the authority it will be registered and you will be assigned a case officer who will handle and assess your application. The statutory timeframe for determining your application will only begin once an application has been registered. And you will be notified of this in writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe case officer will be your principal point of contact to understand any emerging issues, or the status of your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"determination-and-public-consultation\"\u003eDetermination and public consultation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow follows the determination period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local planning authority should decide on the application as quickly as possible, and within statutory time limits, unless a longer period has been agreed with you in writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe statutory time limits for determination are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e13 weeks for major developments\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e8 weeks for all other types of development\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your development requires an environmental impact assessment this will be extended to 16 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local planning authority is required to carry out a formal period of public consultation prior to its decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsultation letters will be sent to any affected properties and statutory consultees at the point the application is registered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, the consultation period lasts no less than 21 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePublic and statutory bodies are free to raise objections to your development at the consultation stage. These objections will need to be considered in the determination of your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf objections to the proposal are thought to be of sufficient concern, this should be discussed with your case officer and you may be offered an opportunity to address these concerns by altering the development or by submitting additional information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis may take time to address and require a number of different versions of supporting documents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny changes to the development may also require re-consultation with interested parties including statutory consultees. Your case officer will advise you of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis may delay the determination of the development and push timescales beyond the statutory period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may see this as an inconvenience or a frustration, but sometimes a delay in decision-making to allow negotiation may be a benefit to the development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it is important to note that the local planning authority are under no obligation to negotiate on individual developments, which is why early engagement and formal pre-application is so important to address any potential issues before you submit your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is really important to collaborate positively with all interested parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"decisions\"\u003eDecisions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecisions on planning applications are made either under delegated authority by a case officer or by a planning committee. Who makes the decision will depend on the size of the development. Major applications (that is applications of 10 residential units or more or 0.5 hectares or more in area) will typically be determined by a planning committee. However, the committee may also choose to call specific applications in where there is an overriding reason to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your application is referred to the planning committee, planning officers will prepare a report and submit this to the committee for consideration. The report should form the basis for their discussion and will weigh up all material considerations, including the compliance of the development with the development plan, and will recommend a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe committee consists of democratically elected councillors and sits in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe planning committee meet on a regular basis and officers will present individual developments to the members for discussion. You should expect members to make comments and ask questions before making a decision to approve or refuse a development by a majority vote. Members are also free to defer making a decision to a later date if they think they need more information to consider the merits of the development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"planning-conditions\"\u003ePlanning conditions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecisions to approve planning applications will typically be made subject to a number of planning conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome planning conditions may include restricting the work needed to build the development or changes to the use or operation of the site once it’s complete. This can include things like restrictions on working hours, vehicle movements and parking numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be other planning conditions that you will need to address before, during or even after the construction of your development. For example, you may be asked to submit details of building materials, environmental management, traffic management and the construction process, as well as providing ongoing monitoring data for assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese conditions will require you to formally submit subsequent applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach application will be subject to a fee so we recommend that you consider whether or not you are able to bundle conditions together to reduce the number of applications you will need to make.\u003cbr\u003e\nPositive engagement and collaboration is critical to understand the information requirements needed to successfully discharge planning conditions as, typically, you will only be allowed to start construction or operate from the site once you have discharged these conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"legal-agreements\"\u003eLegal agreements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also be required to enter into a legal agreement with the local council. Commonly referred to as Section 106 agreements, these legal obligations are private agreements made between local authorities and developers to reduce the impact of unacceptable development and make it acceptable in planning terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSuch measures may include financial contributions to the building of infrastructure needed to support the development, or may seek compensation for loss, or damage, created by the development, for example the loss of open space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLegal agreements take time to draft and agree which is why early engagement with the local planning authority and relevant statutory bodies to understand the scope and content of the Section 106 agreement is invaluable. It can also reduce any delay in decision making, as no decision will be issued until an agreement is in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure that you have appropriate legal expertise in place to draft and negotiate on the content of the agreements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA community infrastructure levy may also be payable before a development is completed. This is a non-negotiable levy and charged at a locally defined rate often based on the size in square metres of your development. Not all local authorities operate a levy and some exemptions apply, so always check with the local planning authority to understand what may be payable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also be expected to enter into a legal agreement with the relevant highways authority where the development requires permanent alterations or improvements to the public highway. This is called a Section 278 agreement. It is essential that you speak with the highways authority as soon as possible, preferably at the pre-application stage. They can help you understand the scope and content of the Section 278 agreement, as this will have financial implications and will need to be costed as part of the development programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"planning-refusal\"\u003ePlanning refusal\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your application for planning permission is refused, you must carefully review and consider the reasons why the local planning authority came to its decision. Often, the reasons for refusal are a useful indication of what may need to change in a development proposal to make it acceptable in planning terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy discussing the reasons for refusal with your case officer, you can make an informed decision about your next steps. This may mean that you continue to work with the local planning authority to reach a solution and resubmit the planning application.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a better chance that your application will be approved at a later date if you continue to have an open dialogue and positive negotiations with the local planning authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you think the local planning authority have made the wrong decision, you may wish to consider appealing the decision to the planning inspectorate. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/appeal-planning-decision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuidance on how to do this\u003c/a\u003e can be found on GOV.UK\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGetting planning permission may not be the end of the story. Depending on the nature of your development, the location of your site or it’s wider impact, there may be a range of licenses or other consents you will need to secure to implement your planning permission. This can include environmental licenses, building control and highways licenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is critical that you work with all relevant statutory bodies responsible for these additional consents (including utilities providers) to plan and programme in any subsequent consenting processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo summarise, making a successful planning application requires more than filling in forms, paying fees and adhering to a procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are clearly important, but must be combined with thorough site appraisal, securing relevant expert advice and experience, and most importantly, early and meaningful engagement at each stage of the process.\u003cbr\u003e\nA willingness to engage positively with your local planning authority and all interested parties to resolve any issues at the earliest possible stage will make the planning application process as smooth as possible, and give you the best chance of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want more information on planning your application, contact your local planning authority.

It is a symbol of national unity and pride. The first Union Flag was created in 1606 and combined the flags of England and Scotland; the present Union Flag dates from 1801.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are designated days when the Union Flag must be flown on UK government buildings by command of His Majesty The King. However, UK government buildings are encouraged to fly the Union Flag all year around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance is aimed at UK government buildings. However, we would encourage local authorities and other local organisations to follow suit where they wish to fly flags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"flying-the-union-flag\"\u003eFlying the Union Flag\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere UK government buildings only have one flagpole, the Union Flag should be flown every day except on certain occasions when you may wish to fly other flags, including but not limited to, the national flags of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom, the Armed Forces Day flag, the Commonwealth flag, county and other local flags, and other flags which may promote civic pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDCMS may issue ad-hoc guidance encouraging UK government buildings to fly such flags throughout the year, alongside the Union Flag\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere UK government buildings have more than one flagpole, and two flags are being flown, the Union Flag must always be flown in the superior position which is either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe highest flagpole\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe centre flagpole where there is an odd number of poles of the same height, or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe left centre flagpole viewed from the front of the building, where there is an even number of poles of the same height\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn England, it is now possible to fly more than one flag on the same flagpole if there is enough space. If so, the Union Flag should always fly on top (‘in the superior position’).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUK government building flagpoles should not remain empty – the default should be flying the Union Flag if no other flag is being flown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Northern Ireland, designated flag flying for Northern Ireland government buildings is governed by legislation rather than this guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"designated-days-for-flying-the-union-flag-on-uk-government-buildings-2024\"\u003eDesignated days for flying the Union Flag on UK government buildings 2024\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1 March:\u003c/strong\u003e St David’s Day (in Wales)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e11 March:\u003c/strong\u003e Commonwealth Day (second Monday in March)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e17 March:\u003c/strong\u003e St Patrick’s Day (in Northern Ireland)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e9 April:\u003c/strong\u003e His Majesty The King’s Wedding Anniversary\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e23 April:\u003c/strong\u003e St George’s Day (in England)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e6 May:\u003c/strong\u003e Coronation Day\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e15 June:\u003c/strong\u003e Official Birthday of His Majesty The King\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e21 June:\u003c/strong\u003e Birthday of HRH The Prince of Wales\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e17 July:\u003c/strong\u003e Birthday of Her Majesty The Queen\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e8 September:\u003c/strong\u003e His Majesty The King’s Accession\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e10 November:\u003c/strong\u003e Remembrance Day (second Sunday in November)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e14 November:\u003c/strong\u003e Birthday of His Majesty The King\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e30 November:\u003c/strong\u003e St Andrew’s Day (in Scotland)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"also\"\u003eAlso:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe day of the opening of a Session of the Houses of Parliament by His Majesty and the day of the prorogation of a Session of the Houses of Parliament by His Majesty.

A recipient council must use the funding to support children with a Homes for Ukraine visa who are not travelling with or joining their parent or legal guardian, as set out in the Homes for Ukraine guidance for councils in relation to children and minors applying without parents or legal guardians. This includes: confirming the two forms of parental consent required have been provided; carrying out the required safeguarding and accommodation checks including a sponsor suitability assessment as soon as practicable in line with the department’s and private fostering guidance, and recording these checks on the Foundry system; and carrying out the required post-arrival and ongoing checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.

In addition, if the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is made aware that a council is in breach of the grant conditions above, it reserves the right to recover funding. There will be a reconciliation process at the end of the 2022-23 financial year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"reconciliation\"\u003eReconciliation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMHCLG has conducted a funding reconciliation exercise at the end of the 2022-23 financial year to ensure that funding was allocated accurately and fairly between local authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn cases where the reconciliation found that a council was over-funded, MHCLG will recover the excess funding. If a council was under-funded, MHCLG will provide additional funding. All funding will be reconciled in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo facilitate this process, we commissioned upper-tier council to provide a data return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the £10,500 (£5,900 from 1st January 2023) tariff payments, MHCLG has reconciled funding based on the actual number of new guests who have arrived in a council area over the course of the year, adjusted for any ratified rematches into or out of the local authority. We are not reconciling based on expenditure incurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the thank you payments, MHCLG has reconciled based on the number of monthly payments made. We have also reconciled additional tariff funding provided in relation to guests who are unaccompanied minors that have been placed into the care of a council, as well as any guests who have been placed into the care of a council and leave the care system once they reach the age of 18.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"reconciliation-in-rematching-across-council-boundaries\"\u003eReconciliation in rematching across council boundaries\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGuests on the scheme may move across council boundaries over the course of the year due to being rematched with a new sponsor.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe reconciliation process has accounted for movements of guests between ratified sponsorships that cross local authority borders, whereby the destination local authority agreed to the transfer. This includes a rematch which is organised by a guest themselves, which is then subsequently ratified by the relevant authorities.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTariff funding has been pro-rated on a monthly basis, subject to the length of a guest’s stay within an authority.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe facilitation of this process was subject to councils providing accurate data at the end of the financial year, as noted above. Where the amount of grant paid to an authority differs from the pro-rated entitlement based on the number of guests who have moved in or out of the local authority, MHCLG may recover funding or provide extra funding to ensure that councils receive their correct entitlement.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn advance of the reconciliation exercise, we collected information from councils about rematches across council boundaries as part of the quarterly data collection exercises which inform payments, for the department to understand the movement of guests across the country better.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

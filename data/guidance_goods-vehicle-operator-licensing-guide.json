Neither the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain nor the Department for Transport can provide specific legal advice to operators.

The main licensing provisions can be found in the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995, the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995, and the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Fees) Regulations 1995.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"role-of-the-traffic-commissioners-for-great-britain-and-the-senior-traffic-commissioner\"\u003eRole of the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain and the Senior Traffic Commissioner\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic commissioners are the regulators of the road transport industry in Great Britain. Traffic commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport but act independently from Government and the enforcement agencies, for example, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTheir function is to ensure that only safe and reliable operators of goods and passenger vehicles are permitted to be licensed. Further information can be found on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eTraffic Commissioners for Great Britain’s website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of operator licensing, Great Britain is divided into eight \u003ca href=\"#Annex2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etraffic areas\u003c/a\u003e. A traffic commissioner is deployed by the Senior Traffic Commissioner to be responsible for a specific \u003ca href=\"#Annex2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etraffic area\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will consider and grant a licence based on the undertakings given by the applicant, and they are entitled to expect the operator to comply with those undertakings during the life of the licence. Traffic commissioners may take regulatory action against an operator if they fail to comply - where they may revoke, suspend or curtail an operator’s licence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Senior Traffic Commissioner is appointed with legal powers to deploy traffic commissioners and to provide statutory guidance and statutory directions to traffic commissioners on how they should approach their functions. This helps to ensure a consistency of approach and provides useful advice for other service users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese documents will be referenced throughout this guide as the Senior Traffic Commissioner’s Statutory Documents which are uploaded on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/senior-traffic-commissioners-statutory-guidance-and-statutory-directions\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eTraffic Commissioners’ website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic commissioners are supported in their functions by Deputy Traffic Commissioners. Deputy Traffic Commissioners are deployed for the days they are required. They are not full-time appointments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdministrative support to the traffic commissioners is provided by staff based in the Office of the Traffic Commissioner. Staff are either based in the Licensing Team in Leeds or in the Compliance Team which is based in eight regional locations.

For example, a tractor unit is a goods vehicle and where a unit is conveying empty trailers to and from the testing station, it would be regarded as the carriage of goods. In this case the ‘goods’ are the trailers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"exemptions-from-goods-vehicle-operator-licensing\"\u003eExemptions from goods vehicle operator licensing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome vehicles (or usage) are exempt from requiring an operator’s licence.

Any operation outside of an exemption requires an operator’s licence no matter how short the period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is your responsibility to ensure that an exemption applies to your operation or vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"types-of-goods-vehicle-operators-licence\"\u003eTypes of goods vehicle operator’s licence\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three types of goods vehicle operator’s licences. The type of licence required will depend on the use of the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe different types of licence are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003ch4 id=\"standard-international-licence\"\u003eStandard international licence\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA standard international licence allows you to carry your own goods, and goods for other people for hire or reward, both in the United Kingdom and on international journeys. Operators who are issued with standard international licences will also receive a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-licence-for-the-community-for-international-road-haulage\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Licence for the Community\u003c/a\u003e.

Where the operator only carries goods that are, or become and then remain, the operator’s own property, a restricted licence is likely to be appropriate. It is important to consider the purpose of the operation. For example, the recovery of vehicles does not include the return of that vehicle once it has been repaired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"correct-licence-type\"\u003eCorrect licence type\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA restricted licence is only appropriate for the carriage of the operator’s own goods (i.e. the goods are the property of the business or, in the case of a company that entity or its parent or subsidiary) and on their own account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDetermining the correct type of licence might be a question of fact and degree, but if you answer yes to the following questions, it is likely to suggest that the operation is likely to require a standard licence:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis the transport of the goods a predominant part of the service provided?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edoes the operator hold, and rely on when carrying those goods, a type of insurance policy that covers carriage of goods for reward?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edoes the carrying result in payment, direct or indirect, which benefits the owner or user of the vehicle?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"classes-of-vehicles-authorised\"\u003eClasses of vehicles authorised\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGoods vehicle operator’s licences can authorise the use of different classes of vehicles (or combination of vehicles and trailers).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA licence authorising the use of vehicles or combinations over 3.5 tonnes is called a ‘heavy goods vehicle licence’.

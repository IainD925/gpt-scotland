Like comparative studies (see ‘2. Comparative studies’ in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/choose-evaluation-methods-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eChoose evaluation methods: evaluating digital health products\u003c/a\u003e), economic evaluation always involves a comparison, so you will need evidence on both your digital product and alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEconomic evaluation can be used to inform decisions about the economic impact and relative value for money of digital health products. It can tell you whether differences in costs between your product and competing alternatives can be justified in terms of health and non-health benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"planning-an-economic-evaluation\"\u003ePlanning an economic evaluation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some important methodological aspects that you should consider when undertaking an economic evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"choosing-a-comparison\"\u003eChoosing a comparison\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing what to compare your product to (the comparator) is important. You should consider:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat your product intends to displace or compete with\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat evidence is available on costs and effects\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRelevant comparators could be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean alternative way of implementing your product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea competing product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eexisting technology, before your product became available\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enot using your product (often known as ‘do nothing’)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"deciding-the-study-perspective\"\u003eDeciding the study perspective\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe study perspective is the point of view you will take for the economic evaluation. This is important because it determines which costs and effects are relevant to your analysis and need to be captured. For example, the reduction of psychiatric hospital beds might seem cost-effective from the perspective of the NHS but less so from that of society as a whole, including patients’ or carers’ perspectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA societal perspective helps detect cost shifting between different sectors, for example formal and informal care, or health and economy sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTypical viewpoints are those of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe patient\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe healthcare provider – for example, a hospital\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe healthcare system\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esociety\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the UK, economic analyses often take the perspective of the NHS and personal and social services. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends this approach for decisions taken at the national level. Economic evaluation using this perspective should include all costs to the health and social care system. In terms of health outcomes, this perspective only considers health-related benefits to patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA societal perspective considers all relevant costs, whoever pays for them. This includes non-healthcare costs, such as productivity losses, informal care, and out-of-pocket expenses. This perspective also includes benefits beyond those to the patient, such as benefits to caregivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may need a broader societal perspective, for example if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe costs associated with your digital product are borne by different parties, such as the NHS and the patient\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyour digital product is likely to provide important non-health benefits, such as productivity gains and social inclusion\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"measuring-costs-and-effects\"\u003eMeasuring costs and effects\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"costs\"\u003eCosts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can calculate costs by identifying, quantifying and valuing resource use associated with the interventions you’re comparing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo identify relevant resource use, consider how your digital product impacts on the patient, provider and healthcare system. This emphasises the importance of considering a broader study perspective that includes resource use beyond costs to the NHS. For example, your digital product might impact on patients’ productivity and travel costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen identifying relevant resource use, also think about the implications of providing your product for general use. For example, consider whether:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto include resources related to product development (these would usually be excluded if, for example, your product was a modification of an existing one)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyour product will be free or users will pay for it\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere will be any resource implications to scaling up your product (for example, maintenance resources)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you have identified all resource use, you need to plan how to measure those resources consumed by the patient, healthcare system or other party as a result of using your digital product. This data should be based on physical measures, such as the time spent facilitating your product. You might be able to get this data from:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emedical records (routinely collected data)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epatient-completed diaries\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eprospective patient forms\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edata collected through websites or mobile applications – for example, they might record how many times patients or health professionals interacted with your product or the time they spent with it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo work out costs from resource use data, apply appropriate unit costs. Unit costs are the cost per unit of an item of resource use, such as the hourly wage of a health professional that will be applied to the time spent interacting with your product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen valuing resource use, use national sources for unit costs (such as \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/costing-in-the-nhs/approved-costing-guidance/approved-costing-guidance-2022/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNHS Reference Costs\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.pssru.ac.uk/project-pages/unit-costs/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUnit Costs for Health and Social Care\u003c/a\u003e) if possible, even if decision-making is at the local level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"effects\"\u003eEffects\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe measurement of effects should relate to the purpose of your digital product. You may want to use a broader study perspective, so that the economic study can include both health and non-health effects. Health-related effects might be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edisease-specific, for example lowering cholesterol levels\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egeneric, such as improving health-related quality of life\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNon-health effects might include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eimprovements to the way patients interact with the health system\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eimproved patient empowerment\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egreater social inclusion\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"incremental-approach\"\u003eIncremental approach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn incremental approach involves estimating the incremental (or additional) cost and incremental effect of an intervention compared to alternative options. It can tell you the marginal cost of producing one additional unit of benefit of your product compared to alternative options. This is crucial when comparing alternative digital products competing for available resources. It allows the decision maker to efficiently allocate resources by providing digital products that have the lowest cost per unit of benefit gained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"example-of-an-incremental-approach\"\u003eExample of an incremental approach\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou are launching an extension to an existing product, and the decision-maker needs to decide whether to adopt the new extended product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour existing product detects 10 cases of type 2 diabetes. The extended product detects 12 cases but costs an extra £60,000. An average cost per case of the extended product would be £5,000, but using this information to inform resource allocation over-estimates value for money because it ignores that the existing product already detects 10 cases. It is the incremental change in costs and effects that matters, which would result in a cost per case detected of £30,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"setting-the-boundaries-of-the-evaluation\"\u003eSetting the boundaries of the evaluation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to decide the time horizon for your economic evaluation. This is the duration over which you will measure costs and effects. It should be long enough to capture all important differences in costs and effects between your product and alternative options, taking into account the limitations of the available evidence.

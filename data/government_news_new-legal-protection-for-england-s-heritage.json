Individuals who want to remove any historic statue, whether listed or not, will now require listed building consent or planning permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the new regulations, if the council intends to grant permission for removal of a particular statue and Historic England objects, the Communities Secretary will be notified so he can make the final decision about the application in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistoric England and the Secretary of State will apply the new policy of “retain and explain”, meaning historic statues will only be removed in the most exceptional circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany unlisted heritage assets are of interest, significance and pride to the local communities in which they are erected and it is right that protections are put in place for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese new laws will protect 20,000 statues and monuments throughout England for future generations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese landmark legal changes come in the tradition of previous landmark heritage protection laws such as the Civic Amenities Act 1967 and the Town \u0026amp; Country Planning Act 1947.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommunities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eFor hundreds of years, public statues and monuments have been erected across the country to celebrate individuals and great moments in British history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThey reflected the people’s preferences at the time, not a single, official narrative or doctrine. They are hugely varied, some loved, some reviled, but all part of the weft and weave of our uniquely rich history and built environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWe cannot – and should not – now try to edit or censor our past. That’s why I am changing the law to protect historic monuments and ensure we don’t repeat the errors of previous generations, losing our inheritance of the past without proper care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWhat has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully, not removed on a whim, any removal should require planning permission and local people should have the chance to be properly consulted. Our policy in law will be clear, that we believe in explaining and retaining heritage, not tearing it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCulture Secretary Rt Hon Oliver Dowden MP said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eI strongly believe that we should learn from our past – in order to retain and explain our rich history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe decisions we make now will shape the environment inherited by our children and grandchildren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eIt is our duty to preserve our culture and heritage for future generations and these new laws will help to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new rules will also apply to unlisted historic plaques, memorials or monuments which will also require planning permission and Historic England to be informed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_c1f13fd8-9feb-4028-9323-7cb3383323b4\" class=\"contact\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eMedia enquiries\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n        \u003cp class=\"email\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eEmail\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"mailto:newsdesk@communities.gov.uk\" class=\"email\"\u003enewsdesk@communities.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003ePlease use this number if you are a journalist wishing to speak to Press Office\u003c/span\u003e\n          0303 444 1209\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eOffice address and general enquiries\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003e2 Marsham StreetLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1P 4DF\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"contact_form_url\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eContact form\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-the-ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government\"\u003ehttps://www.gov.uk/gui...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public\u003c/span\u003e\n          030 3444 0000\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eIf your enquiry is related to COVID-19 please check our guidance page first before you contact us - \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government\"\u003ehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you still need to contact us please use the contact form above to get in touch, because of coronavirus (COVID-19).

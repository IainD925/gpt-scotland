Enzootic abortion in sheep is also known as ovine enzootic abortion (\u003cabbr title=\"Ovine enzootic abortion\"\u003eOEA\u003c/abbr\u003e) or enzootic abortion of ewes (\u003cabbr title=\"Enzootic abortion of ewes\"\u003eEAE\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInfected and aborting ewes excrete the organism in large amounts in diseased placenta, uterine discharges and faeces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHuman infections follow inhalation of infected material from livestock, and may lead to respiratory disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough human infections may not have symptoms, where symptoms do occur, they are commonly of a ‘flu-like’ illness: headache, chills, fever, joint pains and non-productive cough. Photophobia, vomiting, sore throat and myocarditis may also occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn pregnancy, a more severe form of the disease may occur, the majority of reported cases occurring between 24 and 36 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCharacteristic symptoms in pregnancy include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esystemic illness with disseminated intravascular coagulation (a haemorrhagic disorder)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erenal complications\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehepatic complications\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese cases are most commonly associated with stillbirth or abortion, which generally occurs 3 to 8 days after the symptoms start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main effects of chlamydiosis in pregnancy are severe, sometimes life-threatening, disease in the mother, and stillbirth or miscarriage. If the pregnancy survives the acute infection, there appears to be no risk of long-term problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no evidence that this infection can result in abnormalities in the baby when it is born (congenital malformation). Subsequent pregnancies are unlikely to be at risk of any abnormality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"transmission\"\u003eTransmission\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe route of transmission to humans is uncertain, but inhaling aerosols and dusts heavily contaminated with \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e is the likely route of infection. The infected placenta and uterine discharges are the most potent sources of the infectious agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContact with aborting sheep, sheep at risk of abortion, dead lambs and placentae are thus considered to represent a risk for humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen lambing and handling of pregnant and post-partum ewes takes place indoors, the risk of human exposure to the organism may be greater than in open pastures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe risk is limited mainly to those actively working with sheep, including veterinary surgeons, and their immediate families. Women are at risk if they have close contact with\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eewes at the time of aborting or giving birth\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enew-born lambs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eplacentae or products of conception.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInfection has also been associated with handling of clothing and boots contaminated by contact with infected animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"epidemiology-of-disease-in-the-uk\"\u003eEpidemiology of disease in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHuman infection with \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e from ewes appears to be very unusual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been generally accepted that there are only 1 or 2 cases of \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e each year in pregnant women in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe annual number of human cases of \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e is uncertain as routine serological testing does not distinguish between \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e and other Chlamydia species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"diagnosis-and-treatment\"\u003eDiagnosis and treatment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagnosis rests chiefly on clinical suspicion. Treatment should be started on that basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagnosis is generally confirmed by serological testing but this requires testing of both acute and convalescent sera. The complement fixation test (\u003cabbr title=\"Complement fixation test\"\u003eCFT\u003c/abbr\u003e) does not distinguish between different species of Chlamydia, and more specialised tests (such as micro-immunofluorescence or whole cell inclusion immunofluorescence) are needed to confirm the diagnosis of \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e infection. Serological tests to distinguish avian and mammalian strains of \u003cabbr title=\"Chlamydia abortus\"\u003eC. abortus\u003c/abbr\u003e may be available on a research basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChlamydia infections can be treated effectively with a number of antibiotics.

Since this date, teachers, headteachers and support staff have been stepping up to support pupils, families and the communities they serve.

However, it may be necessary in a small number of cases (such as when the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e is considering, or the school is subject to, regulatory enforcement action) to commission Ofsted to report on the extent to which the requirements in part 1 of the standards are being met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"before-the-inspection\"\u003eBefore the inspection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"notifying-the-school-of-an-inspection\"\u003eNotifying the school of an inspection\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe would normally carry out progress monitoring and emergency inspections without notice. During the interim phase, however, the lead inspector will telephone the school to announce these types of inspection up to 30 minutes before they arrive at the school. They will ask to speak to the headteacher or the most senior member of staff available. The purpose of the notification call will be to discuss basic, practical arrangements for the inspection, making sure that inspectors are aware of the school’s arrangements for having visitors on site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor pre-registration and material change inspections, the lead inspector will telephone the school to announce the inspection 2 days before it is due to start, in line with arrangements as set out in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003einspection handbook\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"requests-for-deferral\"\u003eRequests for deferral\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA school may request a deferral of an inspection.

Inspectors will take all reasonable steps to work within the school’s COVID-19 systems and processes, commensurate with the government guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will always consult with the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e before granting a deferral of inspection of an independent school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-considerations\"\u003eOther considerations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspectors will prepare for inspections and carry out all other pre-inspection activity as set out in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003einspection handbook\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"during-the-inspection\"\u003eDuring the inspection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"making-judgements\"\u003eMaking judgements\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll inspections will result in a judgement of the extent to which the relevant standards have been (or are likely to be) met. If it is not possible for inspectors to gather sufficient evidence to make a secure judgement on whether a standard is being met, they will state this in the inspection report and use the ‘insufficient evidence’ options, as set out in paragraph 350 of our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-schools-inspection-handbook-eif\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003einspection handbook\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a \u003cabbr title=\"progress monitoring inspection\"\u003ePMI\u003c/abbr\u003e or emergency inspection includes checking compliance with part 1 of the standards, inspectors will make a judgement about whether the requirements are met. If inspectors judge that the standards in part 1 are not met, they will record the unmet judgement and provide contextual information about their inspection findings. This will be a concise, narrative account of the evidence seen and will explain whether evidence of non-compliance may be due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

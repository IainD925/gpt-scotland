It looks at 2 sets of participants. One group has the condition you are interested in (the cases) and one group does not have it (the controls).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other respects, the participants in both groups are similar. You can then look at a particular factor that might have caused the condition, such as your digital product, and compare participants from the 2 groups in relation to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA case-control study is an observational study because you observe the effects on existing groups rather than designing an experiment where participants are allocated into different groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA case-control study can help you to find out if your digital product or service achieves its aims, so it can be useful when you have developed your product (summative evaluation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be a useful method when it would be difficult or impossible to randomise participants, for example, if your product aims to help people with rare health conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pros\"\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCase-control studies have many benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehelp to estimate the effects of your digital product when randomisation is not possible\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003euse existing data, which could be cheaper and easier\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eoperate with fewer participants compared to other designs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cons\"\u003eCons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere can also be drawbacks of a case-control study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou need to pay careful attention to factors that may influence your results, confounding factors and biases – see explanation in ‘How to carry out a case-control study’ below\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere may be challenges when accessing pre-existing data\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou cannot draw definitive answers about the effects of your product as you haven’t randomly selected participants for your evaluation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-a-case-control-study\"\u003eHow to carry out a case-control study\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a traditional case-control design, cases and controls are looked at retrospectively – that is, the health condition and the factor that might have caused it have already occurred when you start the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSources of cases and controls typically include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eroutinely collected data at medical facilities\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edisease registries\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecross-sectional surveys\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome researchers use the term prospective case-control study when, for example, a prospective group exposed to an intervention is compared to a retrospective control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"choosing-your-control\"\u003eChoosing your control\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSelecting an appropriate control is an important part of a case-control study. The comparison group should be as similar as possible to the source population that produced the cases. This means the participants will be similar to each other in terms of factors that may influence the outcomes you’re looking at. Ideally, they will only differ in whether they received your digital product (cases) or not (controls).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 2 main types of case-control design: matched and unmatched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially, in an unmatched case-control design, a shared control group is selected for all cases at random given certain attributes. In a matched case-control design, controls are selected case-by-case based on specified characteristics. You should pick characteristics that have an effect on the usage of digital devices and services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCommonly used matching factors include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eage\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esex\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esocio-economic status\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, think about other characteristics and attributes that might influence the use of your product, and the subsequent outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"confounding-variables-and-biases\"\u003eConfounding variables and biases\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConfounding variables (variables other than the one you are interested in that may influence the results) and biases (errors that influence the sample selected and results observed) are important to consider when conducting any research. This is especially important in designs that are non-randomised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eselection bias can happen when participants are assigned without randomisation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eattribution bias may occur when patients with unfavourable outcomes are less likely to attend follow-ups\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"analysing-your-data\"\u003eAnalysing your data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe analysis most commonly used in case-control studies is an odds ratio, which is the chance (odds) of the outcomes occurring in the case group versus the control group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-can-telemedicine-help-with-post-bariatric-surgery-care-a-case-control-design\"\u003eExample: Can telemedicine help with post-bariatric surgery care? A case-control design\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, Wang and colleagues published a paper entitled \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333409198_Exploring_the_Effects_of_Telemedicine_on_Bariatric_Surgery_Follow-up_a_Matched_Case_Control_Study\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eExploring the Effects of Telemedicine on Bariatric Surgery Follow-up: a Matched Case Control Study\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe study showed that people who go through bariatric surgery have better outcomes if they attend their follow-up appointments after surgery in comparison to those who do not. However, attending appointments can be challenging for people who live in remote areas. In Ontario, Canada, telemedicine suites were set up to enable healthcare provider-patient videoconferencing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers used a matched case-control study to investigate if telemedicine videoconferencing can support post-surgery appointment attendance rates in people who live further away from the hospital sites.\nThey used the existing data from the bariatric surgery hospital programme to identify eligible patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll patients attending the bariatric surgery were offered telemedicine services. The cases were the participants who used telemedicine services; they were compared to those who did not (the controls).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCases and controls were matched on various characteristics, specifically:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egender\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eage\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etime since bariatric surgery\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebody mass index (\u003cabbr title=\"body mass index\"\u003eBMI\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etravel distance from the hospital site\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearchers measured:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe percentage of appointments attended\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erates of dropout\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epre-and post-surgery weight and \u003cabbr title=\"body mass index\"\u003eBMI\u003c/abbr\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003evarious physical and psychological outcomes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey also calculated rurality index to classify patients into urban, non-urban and rural areas. These variables were used to compare cases (those who used telemedicine) and controls (those who did not).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the study period, they identified that 487 patients of 1,262 who received bariatric surgery used telemedicine services. Of those, 192 agreed to participate in the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey found that patients who used telemedicine did as well as patients who attended in person, both in terms of appointment attendance rates and in terms of physical and psychological outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the researchers found that the cases (telemedicine users) came from more rural areas than the controls. The authors argued that this demonstrated that telemedicine can help overcome the known challenges for patients in more rural areas to attend appointments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRandomising patients to telemedicine or withdrawing the telemedicine would be difficult, undesirable and possibly unethical. Case-control was a good alternative to assess the potential impact on patient outcomes in a service that is already up and running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"more-information-and-resources\"\u003eMore information and resources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA 2003 \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://emj.bmj.com/content/20/1/54\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estudy by Mann\u003c/a\u003e provides an accessible overview of observational research methods, including an explanation of biases and confounding variables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the website for Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.strobe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobe-home\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSTROBE\u003c/a\u003e), there is a \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.strobe-statement.org/fileadmin/Strobe/uploads/checklists/STROBE_checklist_v4_case-control.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003echecklist of items that should be included in reports of case-control studies\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA 2016 \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i969\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estudy by Pearce\u003c/a\u003e offers considerations for the analysis of a matched case-control study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"examples-of-case-control-studies-in-digital-health\"\u003eExamples of case-control studies in digital health\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 2020 \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210778920300957\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estudy by Heuvel and others\u003c/a\u003e, researchers assessed a new digital health tool to monitor women at increased risk of preeclampsia at home.

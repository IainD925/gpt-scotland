This is an external network, separate to MOD’s core systems, and is not connected to the main military HR system - JPA. This is operated by a contractor. All functions within the JPA system have continued securely throughout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis incident potentially impacts personal data of current regular and reservist personnel and a small number of veterans. The data includes names and bank details, and for a small proportion of individuals, addresses. Address data may be place of work, administration address, or home address. Those whose home address is identified are in the process of being written to. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMyHR is not affected by this incident. Payment details of Civil Servants and members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary are not affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have taken immediate remedial action, taking the network offline to minimise risk. Initial investigations have found no evidence that any data has been removed from the network, but we will continue to investigate, working closely with other agencies. We have also launched a full review, drawing on specialist external and Cabinet Office support and expertise. We are also investigating potential failings by the contractor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpecialist advice, guidance, and support is available. We have purchased independent licences from a commercial data protection service for serving personnel. As always, and where necessary, there is access to welfare and financial support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was paid as normal in April, and we are confident that salaries for May will not be affected. Personnel may have noticed a slight delay in the payments of routine expenses. We are in the process of restoring normal systems, and a solution is in place to ensure we facilitate all outstanding expenses payments, which should be paid by the end of the week. High value payments continue, and all outstanding Forces Help To Buy and Terminal Benefits payments have been paid by a BACS transfer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you notice or have been advised that your details are unexpectedly online, report it immediately to your chain of command. Do not attempt to edit or delete the data or contact the website owner. Do not engage with anyone who claims to be you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should submit a Security Incident Report Form (SIRF) and inform your Chain of Command if your personal details are published online. When a SIRF is submitted on the internet, it is reviewed by MOD security personnel and subjected to an initial security risk assessment, with further action taken on a proportionate basis. If you discover your details online you must not attempt to edit/delete the data and/or attempt to contact the website owner. Instead, provide the details on the SIRF so it can be assessed by security personnel. Separately, if you are directly contacted by anyone who claims to have identified you, do not engage. Report the encounter via a SIRF providing the details so it can be assessed by security personnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"support-available\"\u003eSupport available\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe realise this news may cause some anxiety.

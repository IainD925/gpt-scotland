Accompanied asylum seeking children (those under 18 with an adult relative or partner) and those aged 18 and above are entitled to education, but not to public funds. If they are destitute they can apply to the Home Office for suitable housing and cash for essentials, but they are not eligible for other income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as an asylum seeker has not had their application for asylum refused, institutions can provide in-kind student support such as books, equipment or a travel pass.

If the asylum claim is decided in their favour the local authority must provide them with the same support and services as they do care leavers. As such, they continue to be eligible for a vulnerable bursary until they reach the upper age limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an asylum claim is not supported, the individual may not be able to stay legally in the UK.

Most students on distance learning provision do not have the kinds of costs which the bursary fund is intended to cover, for example, transport, equipment and uniforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an institution identifies that a student on a distance-learning programme does require financial help, ESFA advice is to provide support through in-kind help rather than cash payments where possible. For example, lending equipment or funding a temporary travel pass to enable the student to attend exams or university interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"students-on-apprenticeships-and-traineeships\"\u003eStudents on apprenticeships and traineeships\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents on apprenticeship programmes, or any waged training, are employed, rather than in education.

Recognising that not all young people who are eligible for free school meals take up the entitlement, discretionary bursaries are also available for young people who were entitled but did not apply for them. Therefore, the criteria for discretionary bursaries are explained as i) free school meal take-up in year 11, or ii) free school meal entitlement in year 11 and 12 (such as the young person was entitled to free school meals but has not taken up the offer). Students are asked to provide evidence of receipt of benefits in their household.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther examples of good practice include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSome institutions use household income as the main eligibility criterion, using Tax Credits forms (TC602), evidence of income from self-employment, a P60, or 3 to 6 months’ worth of bank statements as evidence.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSome use household income, but differentiate between students with different support requirements.

However, the equipment should be returned to the institution once the student has completed the study programme for re-use by another student. If keeping a laptop or tablet on campus is the best way of ensuring this happens, institutions have the right to set this as a condition.

At the beginning of term, if specialist equipment and/or a travel pass is needed, this is purchased by the college and the cost is deducted from the student’s overall award. The remainder is paid to the student monthly or termly depending on need.

Additional expenditure such as university visits is also discussed, and where money remains, an amount is retained for unforeseen costs.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOne institution pays students receiving a vulnerable student bursary £20 per week via BACS. The institution also gives additional funds at the start of the course so students can pay for equipment and course-related items. \nThose in the vulnerable groups are also offered travel vouchers as part of their payments.

Institutions can withhold payments if a student does not meet agreed standards, but they should always consider the individual circumstances of the student first. The independent evaluation of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund identified some students who had been sanctioned to the extent that their bursary funding had been stopped for a whole term. This is not recommended as it can stop students attending and undermine the purpose of the Bursary Fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should consider the impact on attendance that might be caused by illness, caring responsibilities or other exceptional circumstances. This should be built into the payment conditions agreed between the student and their institution, so that both parties are aware of the potential effect on payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should stop payments where students have been absent for a period of 4 continuous weeks or more (excluding holidays, or if there is evidence that the student intends to return) and where students have made a decision to withdraw from a study programme. Institutions can also take money back from students if they have not spent it for the reasons it was awarded to them. However, institutions should consider the impact of such an action on the individual student before taking a final decision to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of best practice for payment conditions include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOne college has very clear terms and conditions for receipt of the bursary, which are highlighted on their application form.

Policies should make clear to students that they are being supported by the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund and institutions should be mindful of this if they develop their own financial support branding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications and information should be clear that students who meet the criteria for vulnerable bursaries are not automatically entitled to them if they do not have financial needs and/or their financial needs are covered from other sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may want to consider ways to encourage students to apply.

Information is distributed at open evenings for year eleven pupils from local schools. Further information, including an application form, is available following enrolment and all new entrants receive a text message and email about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund soon after the start of the academic year.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn another college, as well as information about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund being in prospectuses, posters for example, the college also works with local support services to target potential students who are homeless and provide them with information.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA college employs a variety of methods to ensure eligible students are aware of the vulnerable group bursary. This includes promoting the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund through partner organisations, social services, foster parent networks, schools, asylum support teams and youth offending and health services. The college works with these organisations to identify and engage with young people considering further education and to provide opportunities to discuss the support they may need.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is publicised on another college’s website, and in all publicity literature, including the prospectus and newsletter. All students are given a leaflet about it as part of their enrolment pack. It is also advertised on the local radio, and year eleven students are informed about the financial support available during school visits.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOne college markets the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund proactively by providing information to prospective students prior to enrolment at open evenings, talks at schools for example. Any young person who attends a pre-enrolment interview gets a card with brief information on the bursary and pointers directing them to the full information on the college’s website. Information is also provided in enrolment packs, in conversations with tutors and via the website. In addition, social workers who work with the most disadvantaged young people help the college to identify potential vulnerable bursary recipients.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAnother college uses text messages throughout the year to inform students of the financial support available to them. In the summer term, text messages are sent to inform students that application forms are available to download and complete. Information about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund is also available on the college website, on power point presentations that appear on screens throughout the college, and on dedicated noticeboards in the college.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"free-meals-in-further-education\"\u003eFree meals in further education\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditional funding for free meals for post-16 students at further education funded institutions was introduced in the 2014 to 2015 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA removed the ring fence between the free meals in further education allocation and the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund discretionary bursary allocation in the 2016 to 2017 academic year. This flexibility remains in place for the 2017 to 2018 academic year. Institutions must manage the single allocation appropriately to ensure all eligible students are provided with a meal in line with the free meals guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to the introduction of additional funding for free meals, institutions had supported the cost of meals for students who needed them from discretionary bursaries, as the external evaluation of the Bursary Fund reported. In the 2016 to 2017 academic year, ESFA adjusted discretionary allocations to take account of this double funding for those institutions also in receipt of an allocation for free meals. ESFA is making a similar adjustment in the 2017 to 2018 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere possible, ESFA has based 2017 to 2018 academic year free meals funding for further education institutions on their 2015 to 2016 academic year full year data and their funded student number for the 2017 to 2018 academic year. More information about the methodology is set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-18-education-free-meals-in-further-education-for-academic-year-2017-to-2018\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efree meals guide\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make an adjustment for double funding, ESFA has calculated each institution’s share (percentage) of the total number of students supported with free meals. This percentage has been applied to the adjustment figure to calculate the amount to be  subtracted from the institution’s discretionary bursary allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA has built in protection levels so no institution experiences a reduction greater than the amount deducted last year or greater than 25% of their 16 to 19 Bursary Fund allocation.   ESFA has also ensured that no institution will have a discretionary bursary allocation that is less than £500. More detail about the methodology is set out in the funding statements issued to institutions in February/March 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe free meals in further education funding rate of £2.41 remains the same in the 2017 to 2018 academic year. If institutions wish to enhance the rate to provide a meal with a greater value, they have the discretion to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if institutions choose to enhance free meals funding, they must ensure they do so in a way which ensures that funding for discretionary bursaries continues to provide sufficient help to students facing the range of barriers to participation (for example the cost of transport, books, equipment). Institutions should not enhance free meals funding to the detriment of other needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can give additional support to students who are eligible for a free meal from the Bursary Fund, if they assess they meet the criteria for a defined vulnerable group bursary or that they are facing significant financial barriers to participation and require support from the discretionary bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should ensure they consider the provision of a free meal, or the funding provided to the student for the free meal, when they assess their overall need for support, whether from the vulnerable or discretionary bursary.\nInstitutions should continue to use discretionary bursary funds to provide meals to students who are not eligible for free meals but for whom the absence of regular meals is proving a barrier to their participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-student-support-schemes\"\u003eOther student support schemes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents receiving support from 16 to 19 Bursary Fund can also receive help from other ESFA funded student support schemes. Care to Learn can provide help with the costs of childcare for young parents whilst they are in education.  The Residential Bursary Fund or Residential Support Scheme, where available, can provide help with the costs of accommodation where students have had to move away from home to participate in their substantial qualification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"fraud-audit-and-management-information\"\u003eFraud, audit and management information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fraud-and-misuse-of-funds\"\u003eFraud and misuse of funds\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department for Education takes all concerns relating to financial irregularity or impropriety seriously and will instigate an investigation where it considers that concerns have been raised in good faith and there is sufficient evidence to warrant it. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/complaints-procedure\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFurther guidance and contact details\u003c/a\u003e are available on GOV.UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for investigating instances of fraud relating to bursary fund applications.

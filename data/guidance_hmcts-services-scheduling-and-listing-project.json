ListAssist will support the individual needs of every jurisdiction and be flexible, to ensure that listing policies can be executed in accordance with local needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eListAssist will provide judges with greater certainty that listing decisions will translate into court lists and provide court users with greater certainty that their case will be heard when planned. Listing officers will have more information at their fingertips, giving them more time to focus on administering scheduling and listing on behalf of the judiciary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe intention is that ListAssist will simplify and streamline elements of the work currently completed by staff when managing schedules and listing hearings, allowing them to focus on more skilled work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn time, ListAssist will work with other reform projects such as the Video Hearings Service and the new case management system for criminal cases called ‘Common Platform’. This will provide a better, integrated service for all court users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/120958/Laptop.jpg\" alt=\"Image of laptop with scales of justice icon on screen\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"key-statistics\"\u003eKey statistics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e500+ Scheduling and Listing Officers will use the service across four jurisdictions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e£3.2 million will be invested in technology\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e2022 rollout will deploy ListAssist to court venues in civil, family, tribunals and crime jurisdictions across the whole of England and Wales\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"aims-and-progress\"\u003eAims and progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eObjectives\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eAchievements\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eOutcomes\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eConfidence: greater certainty for the judiciary that listing decisions will translate meaningfully into court lists\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSigned contract with McGirr Technologies – a provider of case management solutions to the justice sector – to develop software\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSoftware will give a better picture of capacity across the court estate, enabling data-driven decision-making\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eUser experience: a system which provides more certainty for parties and is more respectful of their time\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eProject team working in close collaboration with the judiciary and operational staff to ensure successful configuration and testing of the service\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eCourt and tribunal users will benefit from a more reliable system with greater certainty in hearing dates\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eQuality: Improved consistency and standard of service for all court users\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eA pilot in Oxford County Court began in January 2021\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eListing of cases at judicial discretion will be administered by HMCTS with careful consideration of the needs of members of the public, judicial availability and resources\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"case-study\"\u003eCase study\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnna, Listing Officer:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy job is to list cases to be heard at Oxford County Court. Listing cases can be complex, it involves looking at the court diary system and balancing physical resources such as courtrooms, with judicial and staff availability. My role is to do this as efficiently as possible in accordance with directions provided by the judicial office holder. Getting cases listed ensures members of the public can see justice is done. It’s a lot more than administration. For serious cases, having a date confirmed means victims can begin to prepare to come to court and start to visualise life beyond their case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment we manage cases across multiple systems. I’m looking forward to using ListAssist because it will link to the case management system and pull all the information needed into one place. The system can also do things like auto-list some simpler case types, leaving me more time to focus on working with the judiciary to manage lists, and deal with complex matters that support our partners and court users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"looking-ahead-in-2021\"\u003eLooking ahead in 2021\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of 2021 the service will:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etest the service in early adopter sites to build on pilot feedback from users across multiple jurisdictions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehave developed ListAssist based on user and judicial feedback\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebegun rollout of ListAssist with full training\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehave started integrating with other reform services across the civil, family, tribunal and crime jurisdictions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-we-are-working-with\"\u003eWho we are working with\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eScheduling and Listing User Group\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eJudicial Working Group\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eListing Managers, staff and judiciary at pilot and early adopter sites\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecivil, family, tribunals and crime jurisdictions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eMcGirr Technologies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"contact-us\"\u003eContact us\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmail \u003ca href=\"mailto:Scheduling_and_Listing@justice.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eScheduling_and_Listing@justice.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information-about-this-project\"\u003eFurther information about this project\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/investment-of-up-to-6m-in-new-listing-technology-to-benefit-court-users\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eInvestment of up to £6m in new listing technology to benefit court users\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

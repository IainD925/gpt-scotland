For building work to an existing building which will make it a higher-risk building (for example adding storeys) or for a building undergoing a change of use, see the guidance on the criteria for being considered a higher-risk building during building work in an existing building. Higher-risk buildings are subject to the requirements of the new higher-risk regime directly overseen by the Building Safety Regulator (the Regulator).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHigher-risk buildings, for the design and construction requirements, are defined in both Section 120D of the Building Act 1984 (the 1984 Act) as amended by the Building Safety Act 2022 (the 2022 Act) and the Higher-Risk Buildings (Descriptions and Supplementary Provisions) Regulations 2023 (the Regulations).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand whether a proposed new building is a higher-risk building, the 1984 Act as amended by the 2022 Act, and the Regulations need to be considered together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the design and construction part of the regime, higher-risk buildings are defined as buildings with at least two residential units, care homes, and hospitals which are at least 18 metres in height or have at least 7 storeys. This definition does not amend definitions of higher-risk buildings in other legislations - for example, the definition for higher-risk buildings in occupation (section 65 of the 2022 Act), which can be found here. Sections 119 to 125 and Schedule 8 of the 2022 Act define “relevant building” for the purpose of leaseholder protections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance document sets out 3 main criteria for consideration and includes the relevant text from the 1984 Act as amended by the 2022 Act and from the Regulations with explanations and diagrams. It is a tool to help potential dutyholders (that is, the client, designer, principal designer, contractor, and principal contractor) determine if the proposed new building will be a higher-risk building. This guidance should be used over other guidance covering buildings, height measurements and/or storey measurements to determine whether the definition of higher-risk building set out is law applies to your building. This guidance and the specific circumstances of your building need to be considered by you when discharging your duties under the building regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDiagrams in this guidance document show examples of potential buildings and are for illustrative purposes only.

For example, if a proposed new building contains a shopping centre but also has two or more residential units, then it is a higher-risk building, provided it meets the height or storeys threshold. Proposed new buildings which are designed to be boarding accommodation in schools and university accommodation would also be considered higher-risk buildings, provided they meet the height or storeys threshold for a higher-risk building, as they contain residential units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew buildings that will contain supported and sheltered accommodation are considered higher-risk buildings if they meet the height or storeys threshold, as they contain residential units.

Provided the height or storeys threshold and the use criteria are met within the overall set of structures, then the overall set of structures is a higher-risk building.

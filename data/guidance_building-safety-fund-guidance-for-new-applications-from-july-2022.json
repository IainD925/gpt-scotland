If you applied to the Fund in 2020, refer to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/remediation-of-non-acm-buildings\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for applications made in 2020\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe BSF is part of the government’s wider building safety programme which aims to ensure that residents living in medium-rise (11m to 18m) and high-rise buildings (over 18m) are (and feel) safe in their homes, now and in the future. The BSF meets the cost of addressing life-safety fire risks associated with cladding in high-rise residential buildings where the building owner or developer can’t afford do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a leaseholder or resident of a building in the BSF, read our page containing \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-support-as-a-leaseholder-or-resident-of-a-building-in-the-building-safety-fund-bsf-process\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLeaseholder and resident information on the Building Safety Fund\u003c/a\u003e.

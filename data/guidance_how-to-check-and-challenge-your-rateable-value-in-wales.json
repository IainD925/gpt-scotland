A property may contain a number of non-domestic owners and occupiers, so rateable values are given to each separately-occupied unit of property. A list of rateable values is provided to local councils, which they use to calculate business rates (also known as non-domestic rates).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNon-domestic properties that also have a domestic part (such as a shop with the shop owner’s flat above it) are valued for both business rates and Council Tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe billing and collection of business rates is dealt with by local councils. If you have a problem paying your business rates bill you should \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econtact the relevant local authority (council)\u003c/a\u003e.

This will help you to determine if your property has been valued fairly.

To start your Check case, you must select a valuation with an effective date of 1 April 2023 or later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe date you want a change to start from can be any time after 1 April 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProvide evidence to support the change you want to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe VOA will review your Check case.

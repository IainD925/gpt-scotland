The Bill will make the long-term and necessary changes to improve homeownership for millions of leaseholders in England and Wales, by making it cheaper and easier for more leaseholders to extend their lease, buy their freehold and take over management of their building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government is committed to promoting fairness and transparency for leaseholders and ensuring that consumers are protected from abuse and poor service. The government asked the Law Commission to review certain areas of leasehold law in 2017. Since then, the government has committed to legislate on a range of policy areas through a number of consultation responses. Links to previous consultations can be found at the bottom of this page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-leasehold-reform-ground-rent-act-user-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLeasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022\u003c/a\u003e formed the first part of the government’s programme of leasehold reform.

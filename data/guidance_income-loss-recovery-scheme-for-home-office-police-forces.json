This new one-off income loss scheme (the scheme) will compensate for irrecoverable and unavoidable losses from sales, fees and charges income generated in the delivery of services in the financial year 2020/21.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.\tThe scheme will involve a 5% deductible rate, whereby authorities will absorb losses up to 5% of their planned 2020/21 sales, fees and charges income, with the Government compensating them for 75p in every pound of relevant loss thereafter. By introducing a 5% deductible the Government is accounting for an acceptable level of volatility, whilst shielding forces from the worst losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.\tThe definition of an eligible loss is one that meets the principles set out in paragraphs 13 – 15 of this guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.\tData collection exercises will be used to collect information on relevant losses from all 43 Home Office (the Department) forces in England and Wales, and this will be done three times throughout the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"explaining-the-parameters\"\u003eExplaining the parameters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.\tThe amount a PCC can be expected to receive through the scheme will be calculated by a set of parameters. The parameters are set out below and are identical to those set by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government to calculate income loss recovery to local authorities illustrated at Figure 1 below. The following formula can be used to understand the parameters in more detail:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.\tThe baseline [X axis of figure 1] – The gross income that a PCC budgeted to collect in relation to relevant income streams at the start of the year which should be directly linked and reconciled to the published balanced budget set by the PCC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.\tThe deductible [A + B in figure 1] – An amount equivalent to 5% of budgeted income from eligible sales, fees \u0026amp; charges losses included in a PCC’s claim will be deducted from the losses claimed for, which PCCs will be expected to absorb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.\tThe co-payment rate [D in figure 1] – Thereafter there will be a cost splitting arrangement where 75% of relevant losses will be compensated for by government, with the remainder being met by PCCs, up to a maximum of the baseline in paragraph 6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"figure-1\"\u003eFigure 1\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106096/fig1.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFigure 1 illustrates the parameters of the scheme. It reflects the outcomes for local authorities, which this scheme mirrors for police forces. It demonstrates the compensation received from government depending on the loss of income. Presented as a graph it has a horizontal axis displaying the loss of income and a vertical axis displaying the percentage of central government funding that will be received. Lettered blocks demonstrate the way funding is distributed via the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there has been a 100% loss of income, the graph shows that a local authority would firstly see a 5% deduction of budgeted income (block A + B). Then the local authority would receive compensation for 75% of the relevant losses (block D + F). The local authority would bare the remaining 25% of losses (block C + E) in addition to the 5% deduction (block A + B).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe graph also shows if there has been a loss of income lower than 100%, a local authority would firstly see a 5% deduction of budgeted income (block A + B). Then the local authority would receive compensation for 75% of the relevant losses (block D). The local authority would bare the remaining 25% of losses (block C) in addition to the 5% deduction (block A + B).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility\"\u003eEligibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e9.\tThe scheme is open to all 43 PCCs and their equivalents in England and Wales that have incurred relevant income losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"scope-of-the-scheme\"\u003eScope of the scheme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-income-losses-can-be-claimed-for-under-the-scheme\"\u003eWhat income losses can be claimed for under the scheme?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e10.\tThe scheme will compensate PCCs for eligible losses of income from sales, fees and charges which they had forecast to collect through the usual delivery of services in 2020/21. This guidance sets out principles for determining whether losses are eligible. The principles-based approach acknowledges that individual PCCs will be best placed to determine what losses from their forecast income are within scope of the scheme as set out in the guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e11.\tAll claims for compensation under the scheme must comply with the principles set out at paragraphs 13 to 15 of this guidance, and this must be certified by the force’s PCC or equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e12.\tThe Department may require forces to provide evidence to support claims and may make any payments conditional on such evidence being provided. Grant paid out by the Department may also be requested back by the Department and required to be paid back, if it becomes clear that a PCC has not complied with the principles included in this guidance. More details of this are set out in the ‘operating the scheme’ section of the guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-principles-defining-relevant-losses\"\u003eThe principles defining relevant losses\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e13.\tPrinciple one: The income is transactional income from customer and client receipts (excluding commercial and residential rents and investment income), which is generated from the delivery of goods and services and which was budgeted for in 2020/21:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRevenues that are collected in exchange for a good or service where demand has been reduced because of COVID-19, including budgeted management fee income.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIncome collection must be directly linked to the delivery of goods and/ or services and must be categorised as such when submitting the data return.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIncome from traded services which generate the same types of income could be eligible where the losses meet the principles. However, commercial investment revenues and rental income are not eligible losses and will not be compensated for under this scheme.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e14.\tPrinciple two: As a result of COVID-19, and consequent reductions in economic activity, this income has been unavoidably lost and will not be recovered in this financial year:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThis principle is intended to apply where reductions in economic activity because of lockdown and social distancing restrictions directly lead to lost revenues.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e“Unavoidably lost” means that factors outside of the force’s control caused the loss to be incurred. Voluntary decisions, which were made locally, and which were not aligned to relevant government guidance at the time, are not covered by this (e.g. closure of services by choice rather than because of government guidance). PCCs should use their judgement to determine whether a voluntary decision was made with the intention of supporting relevant government guidance, or whether it represented a departure from guidance in place at the relevant time. These judgements will be in scope of the assurance processes referred to in this guidance and will be subject to a targeted quality assurance process to ensure claims and interpretations of unavoidably lost income are in line with the guidance.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e“Will not be recovered in this financial year” means that, at the point of claim, the income is irrecoverable and will not be collected before 31 March 2021. Deferred income meeting other principles, but which can be recovered within this year, will not be compensated for. The end of year reconciliation process will ensure that only irrecoverable losses are compensated for.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e15.\tPrinciple three: Compensation will be based on net losses. Where a PCC has been able to reduce expenditure, or has received other compensation, compensation will only be provided for the residual loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCompensation will be provided to mitigate the net budget gap which irrecoverable service income losses have created in the PCC’s balanced budget set before the start of the year. Where possible, PCCs should have taken action to mitigate the impact of losses, e.g. by reducing expenditure such as stock purchases or running costs.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIf other government funding has been provided in relation to specific (e.g. other emergency government grant, or furloughing staff) it should also be netted off as this would have contributed to closing the net budget gap in the relevant service area.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhere possible, the temporary reallocation of employees to deliver other services which have been supported by emergency grant funding should be appropriately accounted for as a net saving in the service that the unfunded income loss relates to. This is in order to identify and compensate for the net pressure the loss of income has had on the PCC’s budget.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-isnt-eligible\"\u003eWhat isn’t eligible\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e16.\tIncome losses which are not covered by the principles, and so which are outside the scope of the scheme, include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e17.\tInvestment income\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIncome losses resulting from investments are not eligible, as they are not transactional income (principle one). This covers all of the financial assets of a force as well as other non-financial assets that the force holds primarily or partially to generate a profit/surplus (e.g. investment property portfolios and investments that are managed as part of normal treasury management processes).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOther commercial income such as from advertising, is outside the scope of the scheme (principle one).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e18.\tRental income\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRental losses are not eligible, as they are not transactional income (principle one).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e19.\tCompensation paid to third parties for loss of revenue\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSome services are contracted out, such that the force does not directly deliver the service.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn some cases, forces subsidise services either directly or through a management charge. These PCCs may have seen an unplanned increase in this budgeted expenditure because of COVID-19, which may be irrecoverable. This additional spending would not be in scope of the scheme, as the subsidisation of services through increased payments does not represent a loss of income to the force (principle one).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn other cases, forces are making additional payments to a) ensure the wider sustainability of providers and/or b) support the extra costs of providing services in a COVID-19 compliant way. These payments would not be in scope of the scheme as they do not represent a loss of income (principle one).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e20.\tIncome which was not included in the PCC’s general fund budget for 2020/21\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFor a loss to be eligible under the scheme the PCC must have a related budget amount built into its general fund revenue budget for 2020/21. Any other income losses (e.g. losses incurred directly by a force owned company) will not be eligible (principle one).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIf a service is transferred back to the force during the year this will not be covered under the scheme on the basis that it did not form part of the PCC’s budget at the start of the year (principle one).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e21.\tIncome that can reasonably be recovered later in the financial year\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhere a force knows that it can recover a loss within the financial year, the Department expects the PCC to take reasonable steps to recover that income and that loss will not be eligible (principle two).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHowever, the Department acknowledges that forces may not yet know whether some of these income losses may be recoverable. As such, PCCs may claim for a loss if they have a reasonable basis to believe that recovery is unlikely (principle two).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA reconciliation process (paras 25 – 27) will be carried out after the end of the financial year, and any grant paid in respect of losses that were ultimately recovered will be repayable to the Government.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e22.\tIncome losses which can be mitigated by reductions in expenditure, or which have already been compensated for by other government funding\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhilst a reduction of service delivery may have led to a loss in income, it may have also led to some savings in planned expenditure. Where this is the case, PCCs should only claim for the net loss. This will mean that the income scheme only funds the net budget pressure in relation to the service – (principle three).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIn the data collection exercise PCCs will be required to give the Department a detailed account of the steps they have taken to reduce associated expenditure, and if that has not been possible, why that is the case.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"operating-the-scheme\"\u003eOperating the scheme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"period-covered\"\u003ePeriod covered\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e23.\tThe scheme compensates eligible authorities for irrecoverable losses compared to budgets that have been set for the period from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"schedule-of-payments\"\u003eSchedule of payments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e24.\tThis guidance supports the data collections which will be used to collect and calculate the compensation that each PCC will receive under the scheme.

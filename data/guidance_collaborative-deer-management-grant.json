However, wild deer have a negative impact on woods and forests, preventing young trees from establishing by eating growing shoots and damaging older trees by stripping and fraying bark. High densities of deer can have negative impacts on woodland biodiversity by significantly changing the structure of the understory and by overgrazing on ground flora. The key purpose of this grant is to improve the condition of woodlands, including priority UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) habitats (primarily broadleaved woodland) and sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), through reducing the negative impacts of deer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe services to be provided by recipients of the grant are yet to be fully defined, but will be before any further documentation for applying for this grant is published (this is expected to be before 31 October 2019). We anticipate that they will include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eincreasing understanding among landowners/land managers of the negative impacts of deer and providing advice on the actions that they can take to manage deer at the landscape scale (both individually and in a coordinated way)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebuilding relationships that facilitate effective deer management at the landscape scale and developing effective and inclusive collaborative working (between individual landowners, land managers, estates, stalkers, national organisations involved in deer control, land ownership, land management, forestry, biodiversity and animal welfare)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efacilitating collaborative deer management activities, including landscape scale deer management planning and collaborative culls\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edeveloping and exchanging best practice across deer and land management communities in order to raise awareness, enhance skills and empower these communities so that deer management becomes more effective and efficient\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erobustly collecting and disseminating evidence and data that establishes a baseline of woodland condition relating to deer impacts (and allows for on-going monitoring and reporting on trends in the impact of deer on woodland condition)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econtributing expert advice and knowledge to help the Forestry Commission and Natural England develop existing and emerging policy, regulations and incentives\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe current grant, which is closed for applications and expires on 31 March 2020, is delivered as one lot across 5 priority areas across England. This new grant will not necessarily be confined to these areas, but it will be delivered wholly within England. Activities may be procured in lots.

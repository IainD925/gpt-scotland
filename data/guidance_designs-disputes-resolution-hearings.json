This is where the hearing officer is carrying out the function of a tribunal and the hearing is a quasi-judicial activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-designs-hearings\"\u003eTypes of designs hearings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"ex-parte-hearing\"\u003eEx parte hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe examiner dealing with a registered design application may have raised objections to it. If it has not been possible to resolve these but the applicant disagrees with the decision, they can request an ex parte hearing. An ex parte hearing is an informal proceeding between the registered design applicant or registered proprietor (or their agent or representative) and the registrar. No other party may attend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, an ex-parte hearing can be requested if the proprietor of a design which is already registered wishes to make a change of some sort but the registrar has objected to the amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe hearing will give the applicant, proprietor or their representative a chance to present their case directly to the registrar. The hearing officer will issue an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision arising from the hearing can be appealed, but a full written decision must be requested if an appeal is sought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"inter-partes-hearing\"\u003eInter partes hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn disputes involving two or more sides, the registrar may have to give preliminary views on a range of issues between the parties during the proceedings. If one or more of the parties thinks they are being disadvantaged or disagree with the preliminary view they have the right to request a hearing to resolve the issue, this will be either a joint or interlocutory hearing. Usually the hearing officer will issue an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing but a full written decision can be requested if a party wishes to appeal the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of legal proceedings before the registrar the parties have the right to request a hearing at which they have the opportunity to put their case to the hearing officer prior to the final decision. This is a main hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing the hearing officer will normally give a time scale for the issue of the formal written decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInter partes hearings are more formal and will more closely follow the procedures of the high court with the hearing officer taking the role of judge. Each party will have a chance to put its case and the hearing officer will not allow argument between the parties during the hearing. The sequence of speaking will normally follow the same pattern as the filing of evidence, the party bringing the action will put their case, the defendant will put their case and respond to the other parties argument and then the original party concludes by responding to the defendants argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"joint-hearing\"\u003eJoint hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are preliminary hearings held where the proceedings have not been ‘joined’. Proceedings are ‘joined’ when the forms commencing the proceedings have been accepted, sent to the defending party and they have filed a defence. Prior to the filing of the defence there are no proceedings before the registrar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a joint hearing to take place there is an issue over the actual commencement of the proceedings. Normally this will be a technical issue relating to the form filed to start the proceedings, this form and statement of case has not yet been sent to the defending party and they have not yet been invited to file their defence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe party wishing to commence the proceedings will be given a period of time within which to request a hearing and the defending party will be invited to attend any hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecisions at joint hearings are normally given orally at the conclusion of the hearing and a full written decision can be requested if a party wishes to appeal that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"interlocutory-hearing\"\u003eInterlocutory hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso called procedural hearings. During inter partes proceedings the Registrar will have to take decisions on procedural issues, for example a request for an extension of time for filing evidence. At any time during the proceedings one or more parties may regard the preliminary view taken by the Registrar on a procedural issue as being detrimental to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time a preliminary view is given the parties are allowed a period of fourteen days to request a hearing to put their case before a Hearing Officer and this will be an interlocutory hearing. If no request for a hearing is received the preliminary view will be implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecisions at interlocutory hearings are normally given orally at the conclusion of the hearing and a full written decision can be requested if a party wishes to appeal that decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"main-hearing\"\u003eMain hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the conclusion of the evidence rounds in inter partes disputes the parties have the option of accepting a decision based on the papers filed during the proceedings, in which case they will be allowed a period of time to file submissions (effectively what they would have said at a hearing), or they may request a hearing. In either case the decision will be taken by a hearing officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA main hearing is a formal proceeding with each party given a chance to put their case directly to the hearing officer, and to listen to and respond to the other parties argument. However, these are not court proceedings and parties will be limited in the number of times they may speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is rare for decisions following main hearings to be given orally at the conclusion of the hearing and the hearing officer will normally reserve judgment and issue a written decision at a latter date. It is normal for the hearing officer to give a time table for the issue of the decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"request-a-hearing\"\u003eRequest a hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have responsibility for arranging all case management conferences, ex parte, procedural and main hearings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"request-an-ex-parte-hearing\"\u003eRequest an ex parte hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf an objection has been raised against your design application and you haven’t been able to resolve the matter with the examiner, you can request an ex parte hearing.\nYou will need to write to the examiner requesting a hearing and the ex parte hearings team will arrange a suitable date for the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"request-a-case-management-conferenceprocedural-hearing\"\u003eRequest a case management conference/procedural hearing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring inter partes proceedings one or more parties may regard the preliminary view taken by the tribunal on a procedural issue as being detrimental to them. If a hearing request is made before the parties have entered into the evidence rounds, a procedural hearing will be appointed. Procedural disagreements which arise during the evidence stages will usually be dealt with at a case management conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA request for a hearing or case management conference must be made within 14 days of the date of the preliminary view and must be copied to the other party. The tribunal hearings team will then set the date for the hearing or case management conference. If no request is received, the preliminary view will be implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecisions at procedural hearings and case management conferences are normally given orally at the conclusion of the hearing and then confirmed in writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"request-a-main-hearing-also-called-the-substantive-hearing\"\u003eRequest a main hearing (also called the substantive hearing)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce all of the evidence is filed a letter will be issued and the parties can choose to have the hearing officer’s decision either by way of an oral hearing or, from the papers on file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe parties have:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e14 days to request an oral hearing from the date of the letter\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e28 days to provide written submissions to allow us to write the decision from the papers already filed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf one, or both of the parties, requests a main hearing then the tribunal hearings team will appoint a time and date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHearings are usually held at our London office through a video conference link to Newport where the hearing officer is located. Occasionally, we can hold them elsewhere if both parties request it. The parties are also welcome to attend hearings in Newport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"next-steps\"\u003eNext steps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will write to all parties concerned to confirm the hearing details once your request is in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"designs-hearings-diaries\"\u003eDesigns hearings diaries\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDetails of all scheduled design procedural hearings, main hearings and appeals to the appointed person are available on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-marks-and-designs-hearing-diaries\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eTrade marks and designs: hearing diaries\u003c/a\u003e web page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"prepare-for-a-hearing\"\u003ePrepare for a hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the hearing, the hearing officer will have with them the file of the case to be heard. It will have all the relevant correspondence and any evidence that has been filed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe person attending the hearing, who can be there either to represent another party or themselves, only has to bring those papers relevant to the issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf any party is being professionally represented in an inter partes hearing they must provide a skeleton argument. This is a written document which will outline the way that they intend to argue the case. It should include any legal references they will make at the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe skeleton argument must be sent to the us at least 48 hours before the hearing. It must be copied and sent to the other party at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the hearing officer will have read the skeleton argument before the hearing takes place they will be able to prepare properly for the hearing. They will also be able to remind themselves of the legal references that are going to be used during the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the case is complex you might wish to seek professional advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cost-of-a-hearing\"\u003eCost of a hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not charge for hearings.

There is no upper limit to the award which may be made but it is established practice that the tribunal awards costs from an official scale of costs. For further information on cost awards in proceedings, please see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tribunal-practice-notice-22016\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eTribunal Practice Notice 2/2016\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scale reflects a variable amount for the preparation, filing and examination of forms and for the amount and relevance of any evidence filed. A party without legal representation will be fully reimbursed the cost of any official fees, but will only receive 50% of the amount from the official scale. This ensures that the unrepresented party is not overcompensated for the cost of the proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny costs awarded in proceedings before the tribunal will not cover all the costs of the proceedings and are only intended to provide a contribution towards the costs of the successful party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCosts are not usually awarded against rights holders or applicants who do not defend an action brought without prior notification. However, where an action is defended, the provision or otherwise of prior notification will not usually affect the award of costs at the conclusion of the proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere parties negotiate a settlement, it is expected that they will reach a decision between themselves as to costs and will not make a request to the tribunal for an award of costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA final decision issued by a hearing officer will normally include a statement on costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"written-decisions\"\u003eWritten decisions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you can appeal a decision from us, you will require a written decision which will include the reasons why our decision has been reached.

An appeal will only be upheld if the appointed person is satisfied that there has been a distinct and material error of principle in the hearing officer’s decision, or that the hearing officer was clearly wrong.

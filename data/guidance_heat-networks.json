The energy efficiency is achieved through the installation of metering devices and billing based on consumption, which aims to decrease the use of energy and result in associated carbon emission savings. Metering also supports fair and transparent billing for customers on heat networks. In addition, the Regulations have led to the creation of the first database of UK heat networks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Regulations, the operators of heat networks must submit notifications for the heat networks they operate. They must, where required, install metering devices on those networks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOperators whose networks are fitted with metering devices must meet ongoing obligations including using these devices to bill customers based on their consumption of heating, cooling or hot water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Regulations were subsequently amended in 2015 and in November 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-covered\"\u003eWhat is covered\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHeat networks are systems in which heating, cooling or hot water is generated at a central source and supplied by the operator to third party customers through a pipe network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Regulations describe four main components of a heat network:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit must provide a shared source of heat for multiple users\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe heat transfer medium must be water, steam or chilled liquids\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe heat must be used for heating, cooling hot water or processes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe heat must be sold to final customers by heat suppliers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a heat network to be covered by the Regulations, the heat must be transferred by water, steam, or chilled liquids, but the central heat source can use any type of technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"extent-of-obligation\"\u003eExtent of obligation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Regulations place obligations on heat suppliers. A heat supplier is defined as any person or organisation that supplies and charges for the supply of heating, cooling or hot water to customers through a heat network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to note that a heat supplier is a different concept from a fuel supplier. A fuel supplier provides a source of fuel (such as gas or electricity) into a heat network’s energy centre but may not be involved in using that fuel to generate heating, cooling or hot water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA heat supplier has responsibility for operating a network to generate heating, cooling or hot water, and distribute this supply to customers. Where multiple parties are involved in running a network, the heat supplier is the beneficiary of the customers’ payments. Typically, this is the party using customers’ payments to pay fuel bills to keep the network running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-comply\"\u003eHow to comply\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHeat suppliers with a new heat network must submit an initial notification to the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) on or before the day it becomes operational, meaning the day it first supplies heating, cooling or hot water to customers. This involves completing a copy of the heat network notification template below and emailing it (in Excel format) to \u003ca href=\"mailto:heatnotifications@businessandtrade.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eheatnotifications@businessandtrade.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the initial notification, heat suppliers must submit a  further notification within every four-year period thereafter, in respect of all networks that they operate. Where a new supplier has taken over responsibility for a heat network, it becomes the regulated entity under the Regulations and must fulfil all the obligations, including notifications.

This means that the earlier DECC cost effectiveness tool will need to be revised. In most properties, the tool had indicated that individual heat meters will not be cost-effective. Therefore, pending the revision of the tool we are advising that no further assessments should be undertaken. Any assessments which are undertaken following this announcement using the current tool may need to be redone once the revised tool has been introduced. The requirement to install heat meters to measure final consumption of heat from a heat network in buildings occupied by one final customer will not be enforced by the National Measurement and Regulation Office pending revision of the tool. The remaining requirements in the regulations are unaffected (for example in relation to building-level meters and newly constructed buildings connected to a district heating network and those buildings on district heating networks that undergo a major renovation). The remaining notification requirements still apply.",

This usually involves placing a monetary value on health benefits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs all effects are converted to monetary values, \u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e can consider non-health benefits together with health effects of the digital product. \u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e studies often consider non-health benefits such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecost savings (financial benefits)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eproductivity gains (indirect benefits)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewellbeing and convenience (intangible benefits)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a digital product designed to promote activity among obese people may have the added benefit of improving work productivity and social relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e studies allow decisions to be more explicit and transparent because costs and effects of different interventions are measured in the same unit. For example, if the intervention costs less than the value of health and non-health gains in monetary terms, then it clearly provides good value for money. If there are more than 2 competing interventions, then the intervention that provides the largest net value (difference between the costs and effects in monetary terms) is often recommended for use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e is closely related to return on investment (\u003cabbr title=\"return on investment\"\u003eROI\u003c/abbr\u003e) tools, which allow you to estimate the net value generated by your product. For example, if the \u003cabbr title=\"return on investment\"\u003eROI\u003c/abbr\u003e value of your product was greater than £1 for every £1 invested in it, this would indicate that the value generated by your product was greater than its cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese tools are particularly useful for estimating the impact of interventions targeting prevention and early diagnosis (for example, these \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/health-economics-a-guide-for-public-health-teams\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"return on investment\"\u003eROI\u003c/abbr\u003e tools developed for public health interventions\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-use-it-for\"\u003eWhat to use it for\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse a cost benefit analysis when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou want to evaluate whether your digital product is worth the investment compared with different products\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enon-health benefits are an important component of the total effects of using your digital product\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pros\"\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdvantages include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esimilar to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-consequence-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost consequence analysis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e can include non-health benefits – for example, your product may improve the quality and convenience of a particular health service\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edecisions are explicit and transparent because costs and effects are measured in the same units\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eas with \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-utility-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost utility analysis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e can inform resource allocation decisions across different healthcare settings\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"cons\"\u003eCons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDrawbacks include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe value assigned to health or non-health benefits in monetary terms may differ according to individuals’ characteristics, such as their socio-economic status\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecollecting data on individuals’ willingness to pay for a health gain is not straightforward\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-a-cost-benefit-analysis\"\u003eHow to carry out a cost benefit analysis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should follow the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/economic-evaluation-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egeneral considerations for any economic evaluation study\u003c/a\u003e. Some points are particularly relevant to \u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"choosing-your-study-perspective\"\u003eChoosing your study perspective\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"cost benefit analysis\"\u003eCBA\u003c/abbr\u003e typically considers a wide range of costs, whoever incurs them, and includes different types of health and non-health effects. This means a broad societal perspective is often the most appropriate viewpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"valuing-effects-in-monetary-terms\"\u003eValuing effects in monetary terms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several approaches for valuing effects in monetary terms. The choice of approach depends on the nature of the effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinancial benefits are valued using approaches that convert resource use into costs, as typically done in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-effectiveness-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost effectiveness analysis\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-utility-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost utility analysis\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEarnings or productivity gains are often valued using salary rates based on the human capital approach. Essentially, this approach assumes an individuals’ life has a value equal to their production. For example, if a digital product improves an individual’s recovery from stroke, the added (indirect) benefit might be returning to work sooner, which can be valued in terms of earning gains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIntangible benefits are typically valued using individuals’ stated preferences. This involves finding out how much individuals would be willing to pay for a health or non-health benefit. You can do this using interviews or questionnaires. For example, individuals can be presented with a hypothetical scenario, such as the risk of cardiovascular disease, and asked how much they would pay for a digital product that monitors cholesterol levels to reduce that risk. However, you may not need to conduct your own willingness-to-pay study if relevant estimates already exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reporting-the-results\"\u003eReporting the results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can work out whether your product is cost-beneficial (the preferred choice) by comparing the difference between costs and effects in monetary terms (net value) of your product with alternative products. If your product generates the highest net value of the different options, then it provides the best value for the available resources and should be adopted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-the-ethan-initiative\"\u003eExample: the \u003cabbr title=\"emergency telehealth and navigation\"\u003eETHAN\u003c/abbr\u003e initiative\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Langabeer II and others (2017): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27913657/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCost-benefit analysis of telehealth in pre-hospital care\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emergency Telehealth and Navigation (\u003cabbr title=\"emergency telehealth and navigation\"\u003eETHAN\u003c/abbr\u003e) programme aimed to alleviate the pressure on emergency departments in Houston, USA.

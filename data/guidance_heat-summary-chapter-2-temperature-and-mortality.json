The health impacts of hot weather are not felt equally among the population and interventions should seek to address inequalities. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nVulnerable groups falling ill during hot weather include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose over the age of 65\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echildren and babies\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose with underlying health conditions or taking certain medications\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose who are already dehydrated through illness or alcohol/drug dependence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epregnant women\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehomeless people\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epeople living alone with poor mobility\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth risks particularly include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecardiac illness (to do with the heart) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erespiratory illness (to do with breathing)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecerebrovascular illness (to do with blood flow to the brain)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epsychiatric conditions (to do with mental health)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMental health effects including increased suicide risk, though knowledge gaps remain. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nSome actions that can be taken to reduce the health risk of hot weather include behavioural changes, national alert systems, improvement to housing, and increasing green space. \u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nExtreme temperatures are already associated with excess deaths every year in the UK, and managing this risk is important to ensure a resilient healthcare system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the deaths that occur during heatwaves are likely preventable, and mortality does not only occur in areas of the highest temperatures. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nPeople living in urban areas, or south-facing top-floor flats also face a greater risk. Homes that don’t have much shading or only have windows on one side of the property or which can’t open properly can also get very hot during heatwaves. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nTo cool down during a heatwave, actions include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003estaying out of the heat and cooling yourself down \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ekeeping your environment cool\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elooking out for others\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eputting up external shading\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eusing pale, reflective paints\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eimproving insulation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egrowing leafy plants and trees near windows (because they provide shade)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of increasing temperatures on public transport also needs to be considered in planning. Deep tube lines in London can exceed outside temperatures by an additional 10°C. \u003cbr\u003e\n   \u003cbr\u003e\nIt is possible that in future, overheated transport could lead to a loss of workdays as heat-vulnerable individuals are less able to travel during extreme heat. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nEducation might also be impacted by hot weather: a survey of 135 teachers found that 100% of respondents felt hot weather impacted the productivity of students. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a lack of research about the risks of hot weather on those in prison facilities, however restrictions within this environment might make it harder for people to protect themselves against hot weather risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

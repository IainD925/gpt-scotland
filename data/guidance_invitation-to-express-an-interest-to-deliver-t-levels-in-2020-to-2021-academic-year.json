The methodology is described in paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 and Table 6.1.b of the guide. The benchmark we are looking for is an average grade of “Merit” or better. In summary, the methodology adds together the points achieved by students then divides by the number of entries to get the average score per entry. The same grading threshold is then used to turn them into an average grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all providers are included in the performance tables and not all qualifications use the same grading structure.

We are still considering how this funding will be distributed and will provide more details in due course, after having considered and taken into account consultation responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has also confirmed that in the initial years up to £20 million of this funding will be specifically targeted at improving the quality of teaching for T levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExpressing an interest through this process does not guarantee any additional funding or agreement from \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e to deliver T levels in 2020 to 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"support-for-delivery\"\u003eSupport for delivery\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise that the introduction of T levels will be a significant change for the sector and government is committed to ensuring providers and employers have the support they need for successful introduction of T levels for 2020 and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are engaging with providers early to raise their awareness of the reforms and to ensure they have the time to get ready to deliver the new T level programmes. In October and November 2017 we ran a series of regional events aimed at providers to engage them in the details of the reforms and understand their requirements. Further events are being delivered to allow for discussion of the proposals made in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementation-of-t-level-programmes\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econsultation\u003c/a\u003e published on 30 November 2017. We will continue to engage with the sector regularly as T levels are further developed and implementation begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritical to the success of T levels will be highly skilled teachers and leaders and we know that we need to do more to attract and retain the highly skilled professionals who are key to realising learners’ potential. From January 2018 we are planning to work with providers to understand the gap between the current capacity and capability of their teachers and leaders, and what they need in order to deliver T levels. This will help us, in conjunction with other partners, to devise and deliver the right support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will also undertake wider development work to enhance the image of the sector as an attractive career opportunity for high quality tutors and teachers with relevant skills and experience, increasing the number of experts from industry working in the sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-express-an-interest-to-deliver-t-levels-in-2020-to-2021\"\u003eHow to express an interest to deliver T levels in 2020 to 2021\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders that meet the criteria above are invited to express an interest in first delivery. To do this, all providers will be required to complete and submit a short survey to the \u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e. The questions in the survey are to assess whether providers meet the criteria requirements. Some questions will ask providers to demonstrate how they meet the criteria so that we are able to understand whether they meet the benchmarks overall. Separate guidance is available on how to complete the survey – see link below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe survey will also ask providers to supply detailed information specifically:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eon their current engagement and partnerships with local employers so that we can understand the existing employer networks they have across different occupations to deliver the T levels\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eon their strategy for maximising take-up and effects on other qualifications offered\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe information from these 2 questions will not be used in the selection process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e will write to institutions by 27 April confirming whether or not their expression of interest has been successful, and will give details of next steps.

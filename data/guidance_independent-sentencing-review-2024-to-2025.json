On taking office, the new government was forced to announce emergency measures that reduced the custodial term of some standard determinate sentences from 50 percent to 40 percent of a sentence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-sentencing-review-launched-to-end-prison-crisis\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ereview of sentencing\u003c/a\u003e is tasked with a comprehensive re-evaluation of our sentencing framework. Its goal is to ensure we are never again in a position where the country has more prisoners than prison places, and the government is forced to rely on the emergency release of prisoners. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e To do so, the review will be guided by 3 principles: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efirstly, sentences must punish offenders and protect the public - there must always be space in prison for the most dangerous offenders\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esecondly, sentences must encourage offenders to turn their backs on a life of crime, cutting crime by reducing reoffending\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethirdly, we must expand and make greater use of punishment outside of prison\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn developing their recommendations, the independent Chair and panel are encouraged to draw not only on national data but also on international comparisons. This sentencing framework must follow the evidence of what reduces offending. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSentencing is a matter for the independent judiciary and the review will therefore not look at sentencing in individual cases or the role of the judiciary.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review will provide long term solutions for our justice system by:  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eexamining the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including robust community alternatives to prison and the use of fines\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elooking at the role of incentives in sentence management and the powers of the probation service in the administration of sentences in the community\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elooking at the use and impact of short custodial sentences\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereviewing the framework around longer custodial sentences, including the use of minimum sentences, and the range of sentences and maximum penalties available for different offences\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elooking at the administration of sentences, including the point at which offenders are released from prison, how long they are supervised in the community on licence, recall to prison, and how technology can support this\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econsidering whether the sentencing framework should be amended to take into account the specific needs or vulnerabilities of specific cohorts, such as young adult offenders, older offenders, and women\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econsidering the approach to sentencing in cases of prolific offenders\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econsidering specifically sentencing for offences primarily committed against women and girls\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some important areas which we consider are best-placed to be progressed outside of the review. The review will not consider:  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence or the administration of it\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe use of remand\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe youth sentencing framework\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewholesale reform of the murder sentencing framework: Whilst the review may consider the impact of sentencing for murder on the wider sentencing framework, the department is considering wholesale reform of homicide law and sentencing separately\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eout of court resolutions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe review should submit its findings in full to the Lord Chancellor by Spring 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appointment-of-an-independent-panel\"\u003eAppointment of an Independent Panel\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord Chancellor has now appointed an Independent Panel to deliver this important work alongside the Chair, Rt Hon David Gauke.

Forests cover nearly one-third of the world’s total land area and are vital in ensuring environmental functions such as climate regulation and soil conservation in addition to biodiversity. They provide habitats for a large array of plants and animals, some of which are rare or threatened. Through these important ecosystem services, biologically diverse forests and woodlands contribute to the sustainability of the wider landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eRead the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Forestry Standard (UKFS)\u003c/a\u003e.

Priority habitats have the potential to provide the richest and most varied components of biological diversity within the UK. All types of native woodlands, as well as wood pasture and parkland, are woodland priority habitats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePriority species are those that are declining, rare, at risk of extinction, and/or have special requirements. A high proportion of priority species are associated with semi-natural woodland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead our blog on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/12/the-benefits-of-mosses-liverworts-and-lichen/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ebenefits of mosses, liverworts and lichen in woodland\u003c/a\u003e and how they benefit many species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"conserve-ancient-and-native-woodland\"\u003eConserve ancient and native woodland\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWoods that are both ancient and semi-natural in character have the greatest value for biodiversity. Known as ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW) these are still widespread although fragmented. They serve as valuable refuges of woodland biodiversity, particularly for sedentary species that, once lost, do not readily recolonise. ASNWs also frequently retain characteristics of previous management such as coppice and other traces of cultural history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSites that were once ancient woodland but have been converted to planted forests are known as plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS). Many PAWS retain at least some characteristics or remnants of native woodland, which give them the potential to be restored to native woodland, contributing to policy objectives for native woodland restoration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government recognises the importance of ancient woodland through the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Planning Policy Framework\u003c/a\u003e (Paragraph 175c) and through the ‘Keepers of time’ statement of policy, which emphasises their value, assesses threats and opportunities and sets out actions to protect and improve them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"good-practice\"\u003eGood practice\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-ancient-and-native-woodland-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eManaging ancient and native woodland in England\u003c/a\u003e,  which brings together all of the current good practice in one document. The guidance looks to the future, advising how to help woodlands adapt to climate change and the challenges it brings, and includes information on, for example, harvesting woodfuel from native woodland in ways that will enhance biodiversity and heritage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe handbook \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/publications/managing-native-broadleaved-woodland/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eManaging Native Broadleaved Woodland\u003c/a\u003e, produced by Forest Research, gives more detail and underpinning evidence for the value of an ancient and native woodland.

A simple straightforward assessment has been developed and tested by members of the England Woodland Biodiversity Group, including Forestry Commission, Natural England, and The Woodland Trust, which enables owners to assess woodland condition in a standardised way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo complete an assessment, you need to do a walking survey through your woodland and use a form to record features along your route, then compare your results to a standard set of condition thresholds. You can use the completed assessment to support the development of your woodland management plan and improve the long-term resilience of your woodland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can access the Woodland Condition Assessment forms and guidance from the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://woodlandwildlifetoolkit.sylva.org.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWoodland Wildlife Toolkit\u003c/a\u003e. The toolkit also contains advice on managing woodlands for wildlife, and useful information on rare and declining species that depend on woodland habitats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo allow native flora and flora to recover from damage caused by non-native species, you should manage your woodlands to counter threats from invasive plant and animal species like deer, grey squirrel and rhododendron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead more about how you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-threats-to-woodland-destructive-animals-invasive-species\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003emanage threats to your woodland\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-rules-about-forest-operations-and-land-use-change\"\u003eThe rules about forest operations and land use change\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must consider wildlife species and habitats when you’re creating woodland or managing woodland to comply with regulations. These include the European protected species (EPS) listed in the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 and protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor both priority species and priority habitats the timing and equipment to be used for certain forest operations can be damaging. Use the UK Forestry Standard, European protected species good practice guidance and knowledge from your woodland survey to help plan these operations proportionately, and for an appropriate time of year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re proposing a land-use change you must take into account the relative merits of existing habitats, and the potential impact of change on priority habitats and species, both on the site and on adjacent land. So you’ll need to ask for an Environmental Impact Assessment to determine if effects due to afforestation or deforestation are likely to be significant.

This will include arriving in Tilbury by boat at a celebration in the Cruise Terminal, and on the dock where the MV Empire Windrush originally docked which will be a special event for many people. The displays and performances at the terminal and on the boat will show case hand painted flags telling Windrush stories to the fantastic Walkway of Memories by Evewright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e35     \u003cstrong\u003eYou Are Able CIC\u003c/strong\u003e     East of England     £13,912.00\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe project will deliver a documentary in Luton about the Windrush generation through the eyes of young people, learning a legacy through the accounts of descendants who had varying ambitions to either settle or envisaged returning to the Caribbean after a period of time. The documentary aims to archive the connections as many of these individuals have since passed away but have left in many cases a verbal history with their children. This intent will be to leave a record that can educate future generations and used a resource. The project plan to place the documentary with Luton Heritage Forum as there is currently nothing of cultural significance regarding Caribbean people within the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

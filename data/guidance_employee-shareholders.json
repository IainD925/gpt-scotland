The existing shareholders may find it harder to pass resolutions that govern the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn employee shareholder may be less likely to accept a job where the shares they receive have reduced rights compared with other shareholders in the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you offer the employee shareholder voting rights, you need to be aware that the employee shareholder will have a say in how the company is run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe written statement should explain whether the shares are subject to any ‘drag-along’ or ‘tag-along’ rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have allotted employee shareholder shares there is no need to allot further employee shareholders the same type of share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"share-valuation\"\u003eShare valuation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must give the individual shares with a minimum value of £2,000 at the start of the employment contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe valuation must take account of any restrictions which would apply to the shares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExplain to the prospective employee shareholder how you reached the valuation of the shares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe value to be used to determine any tax or national insurance arising on either the company or employee shareholder at the point of issue or upon a later disposal of shares can be agreed with \u003cabbr title=\"Her Majesty\u0027s Revenue and Custom\"\u003eHMRC\u003c/abbr\u003e.

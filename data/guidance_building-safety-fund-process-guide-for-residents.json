This can take several months because of the scale of the works, the technical nature of the agreements and the amount of funding involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn occasion, the applicant will refuse to sign the agreement, causing a delay. We highlight where this happens through our building updates, published on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-leaseholder-and-resident-service-glossary\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBSF Leaseholder and Resident Service\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere this is the case, delivery partners will make DLUHC aware of this. DLUHC follow-up action will depend on the applicant’s issue and can include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esenior civil servant correspondence\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emeetings with the applicant\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einvolves local authorities and fire and rescue services who can take statutory enforcement action\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"work-on-site\"\u003e6. Work on site\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen funding is approved, details can be agreed with the main building contractor. The applicant agrees and must provide the caseworker with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea proposed start date\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ean estimated completion date\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efull details of the work to address issues with external walls\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe applicant must give residents as much notice as possible of when works will start on site. The minimum notice is 2 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the works period, the applicant must send regular updates to their caseworker. The caseworker uses this information to help keep the project on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose working on your building must follow our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-the-remediation-of-residential-buildings\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCode of Practice for the remediation of residential buildings\u003c/a\u003e. At this stage, they should be taking steps to reduce disruption, including accounting for residents’ needs and keeping you informed of progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"indicative-timescale-4\"\u003eIndicative timescale\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding work can vary considerably depending upon the complexity of the building and the extent of the work required.  The applicant for your building should provide you with an estimated timescale for the works required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes the amount of funding approved does not cover the total cost of work to fix the building. This might be due to  the uncovering of extra work, once the works have started, and associated delays. The applicant can apply for more funding in these circumstances, providing supporting information accordingly. This is known as a cost variation and the applicant should keep you informed of any they make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a cost variation request is made, DLUHC assesses the request. They check that any changes in cost and scope are reasonable and meet BSF eligibility criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWork on your building may be delayed if a cost variation is made. As variation requests are so diverse, it is impossible to provide an indicative timeframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"work-completion\"\u003e7. Work completion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen work on your building is complete, it requires formal sign off. At completion, this involves the following steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe building control body must confirm that the works completed meet building regulations\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe BSF requires a competent, independent professional to inspect   and confirm that works are consistent with design\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe applicant’s contract administrator provides DLUHC with a practical completion certificate\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhere one is in place, the applicant must update the FRAEW at completion and also provide this to DLUHC\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe applicant may also ask members of their professional team to check that they are content that the works have been completed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"updated-fraew\"\u003eUpdated FRAEW\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe applicant needs to arrange an updated FRAEW. This should show that the building now meets all required BSF standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"practical-completion-certificate\"\u003ePractical completion certificate\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe building contractor also needs to issue a practical completion certificate, signed by them and the applicant. This confirms that work has been completed to the required standard. Any sub-standard work must be fixed before work can be signed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"final-payment\"\u003eFinal payment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDLUHC makes the final payment to the applicant when work is complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"indicative-timescale-5\"\u003eIndicative timescale\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe expect signing off any building work to take around 6 months.

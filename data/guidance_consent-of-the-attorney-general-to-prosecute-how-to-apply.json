These are called ‘Attorney General consent cases’ and consent can be given by either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General (known as the Law Officers).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe timing of when consent is required varies depending on the charge, but as a matter of good practice, Attorney General’s consent should be obtained at the earliest reasonable opportunity. You should always check the time by which consent needs to be in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crown Prosecution Service has more detailed guidance on \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/consent_to_prosecute/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econsent to prosecute.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePublic prosecuting authorities should refer to their own internal guidance on seeking Attorney General’s consent. In the guidance given here, ‘prosecutor’ means the person or organisation seeking the consent of the Attorney General to prosecute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsent is needed for the prosecution of an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offence which itself requires consent. Consent is also needed for offences of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a substantive offence which requires consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA conspiracy in England and Wales may involve the doing of an act by one or more of the parties, or the happening of an event, in a place outside England and Wales which constitutes an offence in that other place. In these circumstances, the consent of the Attorney General is required to prosecute the conspiracy in England and Wales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA list of offences which require Attorney General’s consent can be found on the Crown Prosecution Service web site under \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/consent_to_prosecute/index.html#b01\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘prosecution policy and guidance’\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, you should always ensure that you satisfy yourself, by referring to current legislation or up-to-date practitioner textbooks, which offences require consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-prosecutors-role-in-applying-for-attorney-generals-consent\"\u003eThe prosecutor’s role in applying for Attorney General’s consent\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutor is to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereview the case and recommend suitable charges\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehighlight public interest factors which may affect the decision to prosecute\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esupply documents in accordance with the procedure set out below\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-apply-for-law-officers-consent\"\u003eHow to apply for Law Officers’ consent\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following is a checklist of material that should be provided (where relevant) to the Attorney General’s Office.

This page explains what the announcement means for 16 to 19 funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the 2021 to 2022 allocations, we will be using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe confirm the approach for 16 to 19 funding in 2021 to 2022 in the following sections. We have also confirmed the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efunding allocations process\u003c/a\u003e for academic year 2021 to 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"national-funding-rate-for-academic-year-2021-to-2022\"\u003eNational funding rate for academic year 2021 to 2022\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe national funding rate for full-time 16- and 17-year-olds and students aged 18 and over with high needs will remain at £4,188.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe determine the funding rate for each student by the size of their study programme based on their \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-planned-hours-in-study-programmes\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eplanned hours\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-funding-rates\"\u003eOther funding rates\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can also confirm the following other rates for 16 to 19 funding in academic year 2021 to 2022:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe will base the condition of funding penalty in allocations for 2021 to 2022 on delivery in 2019 to 2020, therefore using the national rates for that year. We will use the increased national funding rate that was introduced in 2020 to 2021 to calculate the penalty for the condition of funding when the allocations are based on the delivery in that year\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe disadvantage block 2 rate will remain unchanged in 2021 to 2022 at £480 for full-time students and the equivalent part-time rates. The block 1 rate for care leavers is also unchanged at £480\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe funding rates for 14 to 16 provision in further education continue to be aligned with the 16 to 19 rates.

We will calculate this by establishing the 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 allocated retention factors, which are based on 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 data, and then combining the factors to create an average retention factor based upon these 2 years. This is intended to provide a retention factor for 2021 to 2022 allocations that is not affected by the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"changes-to-the-indices-of-multiple-deprivation-used-for-16-to-19-funding-calculations\"\u003eChanges to the indices of multiple deprivation used for 16 to 19 funding calculations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor 16 to 19 funding allocations from academic year 2021 to 2022 onwards we will calculate both disadvantage block 1 and bursary elements 1 and 2 using the updated 2019 IMD data.

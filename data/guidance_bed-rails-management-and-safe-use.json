Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBed rails are used extensively in hospitals, care homes and people’s own homes to reduce the risk of bed occupants falling out of bed and injuring themselves. For the purpose of this document the term bed rail will be adopted, although other names are often used, for example, bed side rails, side rails, cot sides, and safety sides\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the MHRA we continue to receive reports of adverse incidents involving these devices. The most serious of these have led to injury due to falls and death by asphyxiation as a result of entrapment of the head, neck or chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022,  we received 18 reports of deaths related to bed rails and associated equipment, and 54 reports of serious injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost incidents occurred in community care settings, particularly in nursing homes or the patient’s own home. Adequate and appropriate risk management should be carried out to prevent the occurrence of such incidents. Healthcare professionals or competent persons should carefully consider the benefits and risks of bed rails before they are used for a patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have  also received reports of entrapment in hospitals (acute settings) with side rails on trolleys and stretchers. This guidance should also be followed in acute settings where bed rails are used with trolleys, stretchers and emergency department beds, particularly if the patient is unattended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChest or neck entrapment in bed rails is listed (number 11) as a ‘Never Event’ according to the NHS  in 2018. \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/never-events/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘Never Events’\u003c/a\u003e \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#references-and-bibliography\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efootnote 1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e are ”serious , largely preventable patient safety incidents that should not occur if the available preventative measures have been implemented by healthcare providers”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"bed-rails\"\u003eBed Rails\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, manufacturers intend their bed rails to be used to prevent or reduce the risk of bed occupants  falling and sustaining injury. They are not designed or intended to limit the freedom of people by preventing them from intentionally leaving their beds. In addition, they are not intended to restrain people whose condition disposes them to erratic, repetitive or violent movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse  of bed rails in these ways can increase the risk of falling. In some cases, the patient may attempt to climb over the bed rail, leading to the potential to fall from a height. Erratic, repetitive or violent movements may also cause the bed rails to break, leading to an increased risk of falling or injury from the broken rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo prevent inappropriate or unintended restraint through the use of bedrails, there must be a robust assessment of whether the use of the bed rail will prevent the person from moving freely or make the person feel restricted from moving freely. In all cases the least restrictive options should be explored. \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe NHS guidance on the Mental Capacity Act\u003c/a\u003e \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#references-and-bibliography\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efootnote 2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e has more information on this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBed rails must be UKCA, CE or CE UKNI marked as medical devices, to show they meet the requirements of the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (as amended)\u003c/a\u003e \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#references-and-bibliography\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efootnote 3\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e, in combination with, or as an accessory to, the bed if their intended use meets the definition of a medical device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot all beds, bed rails or associated equipment will be classed as medical devices.

Usually this is because risks associated with installation and compatibility are reduced, as correct gaps are designed into the bed. Bed rails should meet recognised product standards that include acceptable gaps and dimensions when fitted to the bed \u003ca href=\"#eel-dec\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e(See Legislation and Standards)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868784/Figure_3_-_Example_of_a_community-style_bed_with_full-length_integrated_bed_rails.jpg\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFigure 3 - Example of a community-style bed with full-length integrated bed rails.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"bed-grab-handles\"\u003eBed Grab Handles\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBed rails, which fit under the mattress or clamp to the bed frame, should not be confused with bed grab handles (also known as bed sticks or bed levers), which are designed to aid mobility for the person in bed and to help them transfer to and from bed, rather than to prevent falls from bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBed grab handles can pose the same hazards to users as bed rails, including entrapment.  Their use should be carefully considered, risk assessed and documented. We have received reports of deaths relating to entrapment in bed grab handles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBed grab handles, which come in a variety of sizes and designs (Figure 4), are not designed to prevent patients falling from their bed. They should not be used as an alternative to bed rails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome bed rails can also be used as bed grab handles as they have undergone testing to ensure they can support the additional loads from use in this way. However, not all bed rails can be used as bed grab handles. If the risk assessment demonstrates that the bed occupant requires bed rails to prevent falls and also bed grab handles to aid mobility, then appropriate bed rails which can support the weight of the bed occupant when being used to aid mobility should be used. If the bed rail is not appropriate for use as a bed grab handle, this could result in the bed rail breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868785/Figure_4_-_Example_of_a_bed_grab_handle.png\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFigure 4 - Example of a bed grab handle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-devices\"\u003eOther Devices\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed occupant’s care needs should always be taken into consideration in a decision to use a bed rail as well as the environment it is used in and other equipment that is or may be present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBed rails are often used at the same time as other medical devices or equipment, for example, with pressure-relieving surfaces (either passive, for example air pocket mattresses, or active, for example air flow mattresses), monitoring equipment or other systems depending on the bed occupant’s needs. These devices can affect gaps and need to be accounted for in the risk assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"hazard-and-areas-of-risk\"\u003eHazard and areas of risk\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of bed rails is associated with several direct and indirect risks to bed occupants, as well as the possible benefits from reducing the risk of falls. Direct hazards include entrapment and entanglement, either within gaps in the rails themselves, between the rails and the mattress or between the rails and the bed frame. In the most serious cases, this has led to asphyxiation and death of bed occupants. Bed occupants may have trapped their head between rails or been unable to free themselves from a position and suffered postural asphyxiation. Severe limb damage has also been reported in cases where someone has become entangled in bed rails. Figure 5 shows the main areas of the bed-bed rail system where entrapment may occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868786/Figure_5_-_Bed_rail_entrapment_areas.jpg\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFigure 5 - Bed rail entrapment areas.

However, bumpers that can move or compress may themselves introduce entrapment risks. Care should be taken that the patient cannot remove these accessories. For example, a young child may not be able to undo attachments, but as the child grows, they may learn to detach them and this increases entrapment risks from the resulting gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"maintenance\"\u003e7.

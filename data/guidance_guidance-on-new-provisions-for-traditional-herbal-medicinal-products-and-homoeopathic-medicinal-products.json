Overview \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance describes how registrations for traditional herbal medicines and homeopathic medicines will be handled by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) following agreement of the Windsor Framework.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"traditional-herbal-medicines-thr\"\u003e2. Traditional herbal medicines (THR)  \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Human Medicines Regulations (2012), a product is a herbal medicinal product if the active ingredients are herbal substances and/or herbal preparations only. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn certain circumstances vitamins and minerals may be added to the product provided that their action is ancillary to that of the herbal active ingredients regarding the specific claimed indication(s).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor further information about the definition of a herbal medicinal product and how to apply for a registration for a traditional herbal medicinal product, see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-traditional-herbal-registration-thr\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGuidance: Apply for a traditional herbal registration (THR)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew arrangements for human medicines come into effect from 1 January 2025 reflecting the agreement on human medicines as part of the Windsor Framework. However, registration of traditional herbal medicines falls outside the scope of the Windsor Framework and is therefore not impacted. This means that the provisions introduced from 1 January 2021 when the UK left the EU still apply, as follows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn relation to traditional herbal medicines registered and marketed only in Great Britain (that is, those with the prefix THR GB), the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) has the provision to accept 15 years of traditional use evidence from a wider range of countries in addition to EU/EEA countries, provided they have a level of pharmacovigilance equivalent to that of the UK. This is to ensure that any safety issues have been properly identified to support the traditional use of the product. Therefore, the MHRA may expand the list of countries from which it accepts traditional use evidence. If this provision is used, the MHRA will publish a list of suitable countries for this purpose which will be updated as new entries arise. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MHRA may also publish its own list of herbal substances, preparations and combinations for use in traditional herbal medicines. This will include the entries in the existing EU List and the MHRA list will be updated as new entries arise. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese provisions above do not apply to traditional herbal medicines intended to be marketed in Northern Ireland. Therefore, they do not apply to UK-wide registrations for traditional herbal medicines or those registrations for Northern Ireland only. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn those cases: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003etraditional use evidence should be provided that the product or a corresponding product has been used for a period of 15 years in the EU/EEA  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eonly the EU List will be applicable for applicants wanting to apply to market a UK-wide traditional herbal medicine\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"homeopathic-medicines\"\u003e3.

However, homoeopathic medicines registered under the simplified registration scheme fall outside the scope of the framework and are therefore not impacted.     \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that the provisions introduced for homoeopathic medicines registered under the simplified registration scheme from 1 January 2021 when the UK left the EU still apply as stated in section 3.1 below. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, homeopathic medicines authorised through the National Rules scheme are within scope (refer to section 3.2 below). For further details, refer to guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-wide-licensing-for-human-medicines/uk-wide-licensing-for-human-medicines\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK-wide licensing of medicines\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"simplified-registration-scheme\"\u003e3.1 Simplified registration scheme \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe definition of a homeopathic medicinal product is stated in Regulation 8 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor applications for a certificate of registration for Great Britain only (those with the prefix HR GB), the definition covers products prepared from homeopathic stocks made in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described in the European Pharmacopoeia or, in the absence of a description there, in accordance with a procedure described in the British Pharmacopoeia or in a pharmacopoeia used officially in a country that is included in a list published by the MHRA. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe list includes: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eBritish Pharmacopoeia \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eEuropean Pharmacopoeia \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003epharmacopoeia used officially in an EEA state \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe above list will be updated as new entries arise. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe definition does not apply to applications covering Northern Ireland, therefore it does not apply to applications for a UK-wide homeopathic registration or to applications for homeopathic registrations for Northern Ireland only. In those cases, the EU meaning of a homeopathic medicinal product will apply which is as follows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProducts must be prepared from homeopathic stocks made following a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described in the European Pharmacopoeia, or in the absence of a description there, the British Pharmacopoeia or a pharmacopeia used officially in an EEA State. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"homoeopathic-national-rules\"\u003e3.2  Homoeopathic National Rules \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProducts authorised through marketing authorisations under the Homoeopathic National Rules scheme are covered by the Windsor Framework. From 1 January 2025 the MHRA will only authorise products through National Rules on a UK-wide basis. These products are likely to be category 2 under the Windsor Framework.

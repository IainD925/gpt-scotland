Agencies will share information related to the case, review what action has previously been taken and decide whether there are additional actions that can be taken. The local anti-social behaviour case review procedure should clearly state the timescales in which the review will be undertaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere most of the agency representatives have been involved in a particular case, consideration should be given to involving somebody independent in the review to provide an external or fresh perspective on the case and the action that has been taken. Consideration should also be given to whether the review meetings should be chaired by an appropriately trained independent lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRelevant local agencies should always consider inviting the victim to attend the case review to help all members of the panel understand the level of harm and impact. It is always good practice to have somebody involved in the case review to represent the victim, such as from Victim Support or another organisation providing support for victims in the local area or a representative of the victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe victim is then informed of the outcome of the review. Where further actions are necessary an action plan will be discussed with the victim, including timescales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe anti-social behaviour case review procedure must include a process for the victim to appeal if they are dissatisfied with the way in which the case review has been carried out, or with the decision on whether the threshold was met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRelevant bodies must respond to the victim at particular points in the process.

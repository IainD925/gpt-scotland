People are living longer lives and the proportion of older people in the population is increasing. In mid-2016 there were 1.6 million people aged 85 and over; by mid-2041 this is \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eprojected to double to 3.2 million\u003c/a\u003e. Offering older people a better choice of accommodation to suit their changing needs can help them live independently for longer, feel more connected to their communities and help reduce costs to the social care and health systems. Therefore, an understanding of how the ageing population affects housing needs is something to be considered from the early stages of plan-making through to decision-taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 001 Reference ID: 63-001-20190626\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 26 June 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-is-it-important-to-plan-for-the-housing-needs-of-disabled-people\"\u003eWhy is it important to plan for the housing needs of disabled people?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe provision of appropriate housing for people with disabilities, including specialist and supported housing, is crucial in helping them to live safe and independent lives. Unsuitable or unadapted housing can have a negative impact on disabled people and their carers. It can lead to mobility problems inside and outside the home, poorer mental health and a lack of employment opportunities. Providing suitable housing can enable disabled people to live more independently and safely, with greater choice and control over their lives. Without accessible and adaptable housing, disabled people risk facing discrimination and disadvantage in housing. An ageing population will see the numbers of disabled people continuing to increase and it is important we plan early to meet their needs throughout their lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 002 Reference ID: 63-002-20190626\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 26 June 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-range-of-needs-should-be-addressed\"\u003eWhat range of needs should be addressed?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/annex-2-glossary\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Planning Policy Framework glossary\u003c/a\u003e provides definitions of older people and people with disabilities for planning purposes, which recognise the diverse range of needs that exist. The health and lifestyles of older people will differ greatly, as will their housing needs, which can range from accessible and adaptable general needs housing to specialist housing with high levels of care and support. For plan-making purposes, strategic policy-making authorities will need to determine the needs of people who will be approaching or reaching retirement over the plan period, as well as the existing population of older people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, disabilities can include, but are not limited to, people with ambulatory difficulties, blindness, learning difficulties, autism and mental health needs, which may generate a range of housing requirements which can change over time. Local planning authorities may also wish to consider groups outside of the scope of this definition in order to meet specific needs within their community. To enable disabled people to live more safely and independently, local planning authorities will need to consider their variety of needs in both plan-making and decision-taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 003 Reference ID: 63-003-20190626\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 26 June 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"identifying-the-housing-requirements-of-older-and-disabled-people\"\u003eIdentifying the housing requirements of older and disabled people\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-evidence-can-plan-makers-consider-when-identifying-the-housing-needs-of-older-people\"\u003eWhat evidence can plan-makers consider when identifying the housing needs of older people?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe age profile of the population can be drawn from \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks102ew\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCensus data\u003c/a\u003e. Projections of population and households by age group can also be used. The future need for specialist accommodation for older people broken down by tenure and type (e.g. sheltered housing, extra care) may need to be assessed and can be obtained from a number of online tool kits provided by the sector, for example the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.housinglin.org.uk/Topics/browse/HousingExtraCare/ExtraCareStrategy/SHOP/SHOPAT/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eStrategic Housing for Older People Analysis Tool (SHOP@)\u003c/a\u003e, which is a tool for forecasting the housing and care needs of older people.

The Census provides information on the number of people with a long-term limiting illness and plan-makers can access information from the Department for Work and Pensions on the numbers of Personal Independence Payment (replacing Disability Living Allowance) / Attendance Allowance benefit claimants. Whilst these data sources can provide an indication of the number of disabled people, not all of the people included within these counts will require adaptations in the home. Applications for Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) will provide an indication of levels of expressed need, although this will underestimate total need, as there may be a large number of people who would want or need an adaptation, but would not have applied to the DFG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEngagement at all levels can help plan-makers identify the housing needs of people with disabilities. This could include with occupational therapists and specialist access or inclusive design officers. Discussions with disabled people and disabled people’s groups can also provide insights into the types of impairments and number of people likely to require accessible homes in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 005 Reference ID: 63-005-20190626\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 26 June 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-can-the-housing-requirements-of-particular-groups-of-people-be-addressed-in-plans\"\u003eHow can the housing requirements of particular groups of people be addressed in plans?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlan-making authorities should set clear policies to address the housing needs of groups with particular needs such as older and disabled people.

It can help break down unnecessary physical and psychological barriers and exclusions caused by the poor design of buildings and places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInclusive design acknowledges diversity and difference and is more likely to be achieved when it is considered at every stage of the development process, from inception to completion. However, it is often mistakenly seen as a Building Regulations issue, to be addressed once planning permission has been granted, not at the planning application stage. The most effective way to overcome conflicting policies and to maximise accessibility for everyone is for all parties to consider inclusive design from the outset of the process. This is particularly important when considering historic buildings and conservation, and highways. Thinking at the design stage about how the completed building will be occupied and managed can overcome many barriers experienced by some users.

Arriving in the UK from other European countries, Roma communities are no longer nomadic and usually live in conventional housing. Some Roma groups have been in the UK  for some time and will be more able to speak English and are more familiar with the UK healthcare system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2013 there were an estimated \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/migrant-roma-in-the-united-kingdom-population-size-and-experience\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e200,000 Roma in the UK\u003c/a\u003e.

Their second language will usually be either Polish, Slovak, Romanian or other languages spoken in their country of origin. For more information, see the language guide in the Resources section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReligious affiliation will often be Catholic or Eastern Orthodox, although Pentecostal churches and Jehovah’s Witnesses also have many Roma members.

Although some barriers to healthcare are similar to barriers these other communities experience, such as digital exclusion and access to GP registration, Roma people also share many difficulties with other migrant communities. This includes language barriers and unfamiliarity with the UK healthcare system. Roma people who have recently arrived in the UK may not be aware NHS healthcare is free at the point of access for most people. Everyone, regardless of immigration status, has the right to access free primary care from a GP, urgent care centres and walk-in centres. Lack of contact with health services can mean that many Roma people have little information about disease prevention. Poor housing or environmental conditions can contribute to physical health and mental health issues including stress, anxiety and depression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSocial, educational and cultural factors based on past experiences of stigma and discrimination, being denied access to public services will affect how Roma people engage with and access NHS healthcare. Distrust of health professionals, health-related taboos, misinformation about what happens in hospital or previous experience of being excluded from health services in countries of origin can lead to over-using emergency services or presenting at A\u0026amp;E with a serious condition that could have been treated earlier.

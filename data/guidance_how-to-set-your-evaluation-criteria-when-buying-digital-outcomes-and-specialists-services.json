The supplier can send a pricing matrix showing how long they need to provide the work.

You should set your weightings by deciding their relative importance to you, for example if price is most important to you, give it a higher weighting than technical competence and cultural fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor projects with a large budget or a long contract, the proposals may be very different from each other.

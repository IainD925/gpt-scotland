The export of strategic goods and technology is the specific remit of the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU). Exports are controlled for various reasons, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econcerns about internal repression, regional instability or other human rights violations\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econcerns about the development of weapons of mass destruction\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eforeign policy and international treaty commitments including as a result of the imposition of EU or United Nations trade sanctions or arms embargoes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enational and collective security of the UK and its allies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExport controls are not unique to the UK. All countries should have some form of an export control policy, legislation and enforcement mechanisms. The UK has a well developed and coherent export control system based on EU and national legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-i-need-a-licence\"\u003eDo I need a licence?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not you need an export licence for your goods will be determined by 4 factors, the:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enature of the goods due to be exported\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edestination concerned\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eultimate end use of the goods\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elicensability of trade activities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"nature-of-goods\"\u003eNature of goods\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following checklist outlines the broad categories of goods which are likely to be controlled:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emost items that have been specially designed or modified for military use and their components\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edual-use items - those that can be used for civil or military purposes - which meet certain specified technical standards and some of their components\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated technology and software\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egoods that might be used for torture\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eradioactive sources\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main reason why these types of goods are controlled is because, they are listed on one of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Strategic Export Control Lists\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Control Lists are a listing of items for which a licence is required. The Consolidated List is compiled from 7 lists in various pieces of international legislation. The main elements of the Consolidated List are the UK Military List and the EU Dual-Use List.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on your goods, you will need to consult the relevant list and determine the relevant ‘rating’ or classification of your products, before applying for a licence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"destinations\"\u003eDestinations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your items are on the UK Military List or are more sensitive items on the EU Dual-Use List (ie on Annex IV of the EU Dual-Use Regulation), then you will need a licence for all destinations - including EU countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your goods are less sensitive items on the EU Dual-Use List (Annex I items), then you will only need a licence for export outside the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther items may well require a licence for destination countries that are subject to embargoes or sanctions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"end-use-catch-all\"\u003eEnd use/ ‘catch all’\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your goods are not listed on the UK Strategic Export Control Lists, you may still need a licence under End-Use Controls. This applies if the goods are likely to be sent to an end-user where there are concerns about the possible use of the goods in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme. For example, cryogenic equipment could be used in a nuclear weapons facility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComponents that are not designed for military use but which are going into military goods in an embargoed destination are also covered by the End-Use Controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the guides about \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMilitary End-Use Control\u003c/a\u003e and Weapons of Mass Destruction: End-Use Control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"licensable-trade-activities\"\u003eLicensable trade activities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may also need a licence if you are arranging or involved in the transfer of goods between two overseas countries. This is known as ‘trafficking and brokering’ (trade controls).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-licence-do-i-need\"\u003eWhat licence do I need?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a variety of different types of licences that you may be able to use to export your goods. The main categories of licences issued by the ECO are outlined briefly below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"open-general-export-licences\"\u003eOpen General Export Licences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOpen General Export Licences (OGELs) are available for less restricted exports to less restricted destinations. OGELs are pre-published licences with set terms and conditions which you must adhere to. There are currently over 40 OGELs available which cover a wide range of circumstances. Some are for military goods and others are for dual-use goods. A small number of OGELs cover both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an OGEL holder can potentially benefit your business by saving you time and money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore using, you will need to pre-register for each licence you intend to use. You will also need to carefully read and understand the relevant OGEL you intend to use. You will need to make sure that you can meet all the outlined terms and conditions of the licence - eg that you only export to the exact destination allowed or that you keep the necessary records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo check whether there is an OGEL that covers the export you wish to make, you can use the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ecochecker.trade.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOGEL Checker\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a registered OGEL user, you will be subject to regular ECO Compliance Audits. Read the guide on compliance and enforcement of export controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"standard-individual-export-licences-siels\"\u003eStandard Individual Export Licences (SIELs)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your goods, technology, software, destination or situation is not covered by an OGEL, you will need to apply for a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/standard-individual-export-licences\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eStandard Individual Export Licence (SIEL)\u003c/a\u003e. SIELs are company and consignee specific, for a set quantity and/or value of goods. You will need to provide support documentation such as End-User Undertakings with the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"open-individual-export-licences-oiels\"\u003eOpen Individual Export Licences (OIELs)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eECJU also issues an Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL) which is designed to cover long-term contracts, projects and repeat business. This is a concessionary form of licence which is company specific, but not necessarily consignee specific. There is no set quantity or value of goods, although conditions covering this may be set on the licence. Under an OIEL, you will receive regular compliance audits from the ECO, so minimal support documentation is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will usually need to establish a track record of exporting before you can apply for an OIEL. It should replace at least 20 SIEL applications a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"other-types-of-licences\"\u003eOther types of licences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also licences covering \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transhipment-licences\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etranshipment\u003c/a\u003e and trade control (trafficking and brokering) activities, as well as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/global-project-licence\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eglobal project licence\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-apply\"\u003eHow to apply\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll licence applications and OGEL registrations should be made electronically via the ECO’s central online licensing system, \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSPIRE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen making your application, you must attach all necessary documentation, including technical specifications and End User Undertakings.

You should note that these are both advisory services only and not licensing. For more information about both these services, read the guide about strategic exports: when to request an export licence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"responsibilities-and-obligations\"\u003eResponsibilities and obligations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to ensure that you have solid export control systems and procedures in place in terms of record keeping, training and lines of responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a compliance visit finds that you are not complying with the terms of your licence, you could face a penalty. Penalties range from de-registration of your licence to fines or even a potential prison term if you do not adhere to your export control obligations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-you-can-do-next\"\u003eWhat you can do next\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find out more about exporting \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-controls-dual-use-items-software-and-technology-goods-for-torture-and-radioactive-sources\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edual-use items, software and technology, goods for torture and radioactive sources\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find out more about \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-controls-military-goods-software-and-technology\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eexporting goods, services and technology for military use\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"helpline\"\u003eHelpline\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can provide general advice on your export control query.

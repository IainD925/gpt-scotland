They only live on the heads of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"life-cycle\"\u003eLife cycle\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are 3 forms of head lice: \u003ca href=\"#nits\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enits\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"#nymphs\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enymphs\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"#adults\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eadults\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"nits\"\u003eNits\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNits are head lice eggs. The oval, yellowy white eggs are hard to see and may be confused with dandruff. They attach themselves to the hair shaft, and take about a week to hatch. The eggs remain after hatching, and many nits are empty egg cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"nymphs\"\u003eNymphs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNymphs hatch from the nits. The baby lice look like the adults, but are smaller. They take about 7 days to mature to adults, and feed on blood to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"adults\"\u003eAdults\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdults are about the size of a sesame seed, have 6 legs, and are tan to greyish-white. The legs have hook-like claws to hold onto the hair with. Adults can live up to 30 days and feed on blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"transmission\"\u003eTransmission\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone can catch head lice, but preschool children, primary school children and their families are most at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHead lice are spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"control\"\u003eControl\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHealth protection in schools and other childcare facilities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"treatment-and-prevention\"\u003eTreatment and prevention\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor information on how to spot, treat and prevent head lice, visit \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/head-lice-and-nits/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNHS.UK\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

Interested persons include local authorities, fire and rescue authorities, the Building Safety Regulator, the Secretary of State for Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Homes  England and any person with a legal or equitable interest in the relevant building or any part of it, including leaseholders. This document provides a framework for any person considering making an application for a remediation order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding owners are responsible for complying with their legal obligations to keep their buildings safe. The government expects local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to take enforcement action against building owners who are stalling on remediation, including applying for remediation orders where appropriate. In some situations, leaseholders may wish to make their own application for a remediation order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA remediation order is made by the Property Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal to require a relevant landlord to remedy specified building safety defects. A relevant landlord is the company or individual who has an obligation under a lease of the building, or by virtue of an enactment, to repair and maintain those parts of the building in need of remediation. See section 2.2.2 for more information about relevant landlords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemediation orders can be made in respect of self-contained residential buildings that are at least 11 metres high or have at least five storeys and contain at least one relevant defect. A relevant defect is defined in the Building Safety Act 2022 as a defect that has arisen from anything that has been done (or not done), or anything used (or not used), in connection with relevant works, and causes a building safety risk. See section 2.2.3 for more information about relevant defects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis document does not constitute legal advice. Interested persons should seek their own legal and expert advice when considering making an application for a remediation order and should not rely on this document.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"local-authority-and-fire-and-rescue-authority-enforcement-powers-in-residential-buildings\"\u003e1.2 Local authority and fire and rescue authority enforcement powers in residential buildings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to their powers under the Building Safety Act 2022, local authorities and fire and rescue authorities have enforcement powers under the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/contents\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHousing Act 2004\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRegulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005\u003c/a\u003e, respectively, that can be used where safety requirements in residential buildings are not met. It is not expected that remediation orders are used in every enforcement situation. Local authorities and fire and rescue authorities should determine which piece of legislation is most appropriate on a case-by-case basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government encourages local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to work together to ensure they have an effective partnership working protocol and/or memorandum of understanding in place. Regular communication and collaboration should take place at both a strategic and operational level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving an effective partnership working protocol in place will enable local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to share information proactively, prioritise resources and coordinate enforcement activity under their respective regimes, on buildings that may require enforcement action. It will also allow local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to review and agree on policy and procedural matters regarding enforcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government encourages local authorities and fire and rescue authorities to make use of their new power to bring remediation orders against building owners who are failing to progress remediation on their unsafe buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will depend on the details of the building as to whether the local authority or fire and rescue authority, or both, are best placed to take enforcement action. Local arrangements and protocols will vary. Both authorities should consider, ideally in conversation with one another, which legislative regime and enforcement action route is likely to be the most appropriate, taking into account the individual circumstances of each case. When taking enforcement action, regulatory bodies should make sure they are following the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRegulators’ Code\u003c/a\u003e - a framework for how regulators should engage with those they regulate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Chapter 4 for other useful documents on effective partnership working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guide-to-remediation-orders\"\u003e2.

Pre-action correspondence is the communication exchanged between the parties before an application is made to the First-tier Tribunal. It is an expected part of the pre-action process that a letter before claim is sent to the respondent before the applicant sends their remediation order application to the First-tier Tribunal. The respondent may choose to respond to the letter before claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA letter before claim has multiple purposes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit notifies the respondent about the potential claim\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit may seek action to be taken by the respondent\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit may share and / or it may request relevant documents\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit may result in the issues between the parties being narrowed, which should shorten the procedure before the Tribunal and save both parties costs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit may propose the parties consider alternative dispute resolution which, if successful, may avoid the need to go to the Tribunal, and / or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can set a clear timetable for the respondent to respond, with the provision that if the respondent does not provide a response, the potential applicant may issue proceedings without further notice\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe respondent may choose to respond to the letter before claim and may agree with the applicant’s statements.

RMCs are usually party to the lease (along with the landlord and the leaseholder), but an RTM company is formed by leaseholders and the right to manage is acquired by them exercising their statutory right to take over management of a building. In some cases, repairing obligations may lie with the RMC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs set out in Chapter 2.1.2, a relevant landlord against whom a remediation order can be sought, is a party who has a repairing obligation under the lease for the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/30/section/123/enacted\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003erelevant building\u003c/a\u003e.

While the repairing obligation may lie with the RMC, the liability to meet costs not recoverable from leaseholders lies with the building owner.

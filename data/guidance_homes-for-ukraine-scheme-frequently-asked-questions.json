Government has announced today that the £350 ‘thank you’ payments, will be extended from 12 months to a maximum duration of two years. The UK government will also increase the minimum ‘thank you’ payments for hosts from £350 per month to £500 per month, once a guest has been here in the UK for 12 months. This additional financial support is aimed at helping existing hosts to continue with their sponsorship, as well as new hosts who come forward to offer a home to a Ukrainian individual or family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe department will also provide £150 million of new UK-wide funding in the 2023 to 2024 financial year to local authorities and devolved governments to help support Ukrainian guests move into their own homes and reduce the risk of homelessness. Local authorities are best placed to understand the support needed for local communities and as is typically the case for various local authority funding, they will also be able to use this funding to support other people at risk of homelessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eGovernment is also launching a £500 million Local Authority Housing Fund, which will provide capital funding directly to English councils in areas that are facing the most significant housing pressures as a result of recent Ukrainian arrivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe guidance below will be updated shortly to reflect changes to funding arrangements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"homes-for-ukraine-scheme\"\u003eHomes for Ukraine scheme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-will-sponsors-and-people-from-ukraine-be-able-to-apply-for-the-sponsorship-scheme\"\u003eWhen will sponsors and people from Ukraine be able to apply for the sponsorship scheme?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme opened on 18 March for visa applications from individuals or households fleeing from Ukraine who have named people in the UK willing to sponsor them.

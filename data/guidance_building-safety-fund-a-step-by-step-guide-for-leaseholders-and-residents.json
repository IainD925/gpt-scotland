However, they only act on behalf of the responsible entity who retains the legal right to carry out works to address fire risks caused by unsafe cladding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, we outline the steps in the BSF application process.

The process is slightly different for social housing applications and DLUHC has a separate in-house team who deal with these. In all instances, if the responsible entity provides incomplete information, this may lead to information requests which delay the process\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"registering-your-building\"\u003eRegistering your building\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe applicant (responsible entity) registers for funding and sends the following information about the building to DLUHC for checking against eligibility criteria:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe building height (the building must be at least 17.7 metres high)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe wall type and the material\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"deciding-if-your-building-is-eligible-for-the-fund\"\u003eDeciding if your building is eligible for the fund\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDLUHC decides if the building meets the fund’s criteria.

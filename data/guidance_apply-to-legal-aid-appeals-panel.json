The panel considers appeals against LAA decisions including those relating to the refusal of funding and where claims for costs have been disallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking for solicitors, barristers, Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives and Costs Lawyers to join the panel for a term of up to five years from early 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can choose whether to apply for the role of IFA or ICA or both (only the ICA role is relevant to Costs Lawyers). Panel membership is conducive to flexible working as most decisions are taken by a panel member on their own at a time that is best for them. But, exceptionally, you might be asked to form a committee of 2 or more members if warranted by the circumstances of the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCivil practitioners might also be interested in joining our sub panel, the Special Controls Review Panel (SCRP) which considers appeals in high cost and/or complex cases, some of which are high profile. These appeals are considered in committee, normally as a telephone or video conference.

These roles may include dealing with any issues or disputes involving individual panel members. The roles also include liaising with senior members of the LAA to review the effectiveness of the panel overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone appointed to the role of SCRP Chair will also be required to chair the majority of the SCRP meetings, which involves directing the discussion on individual cases, trying to get the members to reach a consensus, and agreeing and drafting a report to send to the LAA and to the appellant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will allocate appeals according to the specialisms you have declared. Volumes will vary according to the category of law but we will always contact first you before allocating appeals to ensure you are able to consider them within the required timeframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of the information that you will see as a Review Panel member will be subject to confidentiality provisions but may be disclosed by the LAA along with your notes or other appeal documents.\nWe provide training and induction for new panel members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"remuneration\"\u003eRemuneration\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will be remunerated at a rate of £52 per hour and reasonable expenses will be reimbursed.

Every decision you make will need to be properly justified with appropriate reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe LAA and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) have agreed an indemnity for Review Panel members in carrying out their functions, provided they have acted honestly and in good faith.

For full details on the methodology for measuring employment, see the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/initial-teacher-training-performance-profiles-methodology\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epublication methodology\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor this publication, the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e calculates 2 employment rates:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea provisional employment rate for final-year trainees in the 2021/22 academic year\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea revised employment rate for final-year trainees in the 2020/21 academic year\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProvisional employment rate: \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e analysis has found that matching \u003cabbr title=\"initial teacher training\"\u003eITT\u003c/abbr\u003e trainee data to school workforce census (\u003cabbr title=\"school workforce census\"\u003eSWC\u003c/abbr\u003e) data from the year following qualification does not fully capture how many trainees go on to employment. This is because some teachers do not start their new jobs in time to be recorded in that \u003cabbr title=\"school workforce census\"\u003eSWC\u003c/abbr\u003e, while others can start up to a year later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e accounts for these teachers by applying an uplift to the 2021/22 employment figures to estimate a provisional employment rate for 2021/22. The uplift is calculated by comparing with data from previous years to determine what proportion of new teachers employed during the year were not included in their first school workforce census but were captured in the following year’s census (the uplift applied for 2021/22 was around 31% of those not captured in the first year).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e’s \u003cabbr title=\"initial teacher training\"\u003eITT\u003c/abbr\u003e performance profiles publications include provisional employment rates at an aggregate level. These are national figures by characteristic, route and subject. The \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e does not publish provisional employment rates at provider level, as it is not possible to calculate an accurate uplift at this level. At provider level, the \u003cabbr title=\"Department for Education\"\u003eDfE\u003c/abbr\u003e publishes revised employment rates the following year. Therefore, in the 2020/21 performance profiles, you will find the 2019/20 revised provider-level employment rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"conditions-of-use\"\u003eConditions of use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"inspection data summary report\"\u003eIDSR\u003c/abbr\u003e conditions of use and storage are that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe \u003cabbr title=\"inspection data summary report\"\u003eIDSR\u003c/abbr\u003e is to be used only for educational and analytical purposes and for informing inspection, not for any other purpose\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edata presented in the \u003cabbr title=\"inspection data summary report\"\u003eIDSR\u003c/abbr\u003e is to be shared only with those who need and are authorised to have access to the information\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe \u003cabbr title=\"inspection data summary report\"\u003eIDSR\u003c/abbr\u003e should be saved in a secure location with limited access\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-protection\"\u003eData protection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen accessing the data in the \u003cabbr title=\"inspection data summary report\"\u003eIDSR\u003c/abbr\u003e, you must recognise the privacy of that data and always comply with the Data Protection Act 2018.

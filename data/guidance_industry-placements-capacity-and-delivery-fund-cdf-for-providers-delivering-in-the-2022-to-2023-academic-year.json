The 2022 to 2023 academic year is the final year of funding for providers rated as ‘outstanding’ or ‘good’ by Ofsted. Those CDF-funded providers with an Ofsted rating of ‘requires improvement’ or ‘inadequate’ will be able to access this funding in the 2023 to 2024 academic year, after which they will be able to deliver the full range of T Levels and CDF will no longer be required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the 2022 to 2023 academic year, the CDF funding rate has been reduced to £160 per qualifying student for both level 2 and level 3 qualifying students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance provides an overview of the requirements for delivering placements, completing the monitoring returns and recording industry placements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders must comply with this guidance for CDF industry placements delivered in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.

The purpose of this funding is to build provider capacity and capability to deliver high quality T Level style industry placements for students undertaking vocational and technical programmes in readiness for delivering T Levels in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are large placements that must be occupationally specific and focused on developing the practical and technical skills required for the profession or trade the student is studying towards. Building these industry placements requires a significant investment of time and resource in building employer links, developing processes and procedures, preparing students for the workplace, and delivering and monitoring the industry placement experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther details on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-placement-capacity-and-delivery-fund-principles-for-high-quality-work-placements\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecore industry placement principles\u003c/a\u003e providers of CDF have to follow, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eindustry placement delivery guidance\u003c/a\u003e, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-guide-preparing-for-industry-placements\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estudent guide\u003c/a\u003e and other \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.aoc.co.uk/ip-guidance-resources\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance resources\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.aoc.co.uk/teaching-and-learning/t-level/industry-placement-case-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003evideo and paper-based case studies\u003c/a\u003e are available to support providers with their planning and delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"policy-and-funding-priorities-from-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year\"\u003ePolicy and funding priorities from the 2022 to 2023 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePolicy updates that were introduced for the delivery of CDF from the 2020 to 2021 academic year also apply for the 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 academic year.

To support a smooth transition to T Level delivery, the following changes were introduced for CDF from the 2021 to 2022 academic year:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewe will require providers to prioritise the development of level 3 industry placements by delivering a larger proportion of level 3 placements than level 2 placements within their overall 25% target.

Industry placements must be undertaken in a physical workplace environment and therefore industry placements cannot be delivered remotely or virtually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe expectation is that all industry placements should commence in the first year of a student’s study programme where they are on a 2-year programme (and during the CDF funded year), with a minimum of 50% of a provider’s industry placements being successfully completed by the end of the first academic year. The remainder of industry placements would need to be successfully completed by the end of the second academic year. Those industry placements that span over 2 academic years can only count towards the minimum delivery target set in the academic year when the industry placement started and was funded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"funding-calculations-based-on-qualifying-students\"\u003eFunding calculations based on qualifying students\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCDF allocations made for the 2022 to 2023 academic year will be calculated based on the number of qualifying students enrolled on a level 2 or level 3 vocational and technical qualification (VTQ) with each provider in the 2020 to 2021 academic year.

Providers have been notified of the minimum number of industry placements they must deliver for students on either level 2 or level 3 programmes in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. Only qualifications in the relevant SSAs or from the eligible AGQ list will count towards the target. We will be reviewing the data to confirm that the number of placements providers have recorded in the ILR, or school census matches the data provided in monitoring returns. Providers must ensure that each industry placement is recorded correctly, showing the start and end date and the number of planned hours. Failure to record CDF industry placements correctly may lead to funding being reclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe learning aim reference number for recording CDF industry placements on the ILR and the school census is ZWRKX002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCDF industry placements must take place on top of the existing study programme hours as CDF funding is allocated in addition to mainstream funding for qualifying students. Therefore, industry placement hours must not be included in the planned hours recorded for the study programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also important to note that, where hours are currently spent on work experience that is an existing and compulsory part of the qualification hours in a study programme, these work experience hours cannot be counted towards the industry placement hours delivered through CDF, because providers are already being funded for these through mainstream study programmes funding. For the industry placement to be counted, students would need to do the required industry placement hours (minimum of 315) on top of the hours of work experience that are recorded as planned ‘qualification hours’ on the ILR and school census.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProviders that have been selected to deliver T Levels from the 2022 to 2023 academic year must deliver an industry placement for each student, but these cannot be counted as part of the CDF target as they are funded through the T Level funding. T Level industry placements must be recorded using the learning aim reference number ZWRKX003. This learning aim reference is specifically for T Level industry placement activity and that code must not be used for CDF industry placements.

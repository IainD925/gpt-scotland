The position is a statutory office established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJACO leads a small team of caseworkers to research and identify issues in these cases, the majority considering questions of process and fact before producing final reports and recommendations. There is no formal right to appeal the Ombudsman’s decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDouglas Marshall carries out work for Cumbria Constabulary as a Police Staff Senior Investigating Officer and is a Director of Hawk Detective Services who are based in Scotland. He completed 30 years’ service with Cumbria Constabulary prior to returning in a staff capacity and, at the latter end of his service, was the Deputy National Co-ordinator on Operation Hydrant (the national policing response, oversight and co-ordination of non-recent child sexual abuse). He was Senior Investigating Officer on several high-profile cases in Cumbria.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

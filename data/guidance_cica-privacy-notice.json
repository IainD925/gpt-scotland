There is a list of possible lawful bases in the UK General Data Protection Regulation. You can find out more about what is a lawful basis on the Information Commissioner’s Office website.              \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawful basis we rely on may affect your data protection rights which are described further below. You can find out more about your data protection rights and the exemptions which may apply on the Information Commissioner’s Office website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur lawful basis for processing personal information is the performance of a public task, which is to administer the Compensation Schemes and the Hardship Fund. This means we have to collect and use your information to carry out a task laid down in law, which the law intends to be performed by an organisation such as ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe extent to which we need to share and obtain your personal information will be determined on a case-by-case basis according to what is reasonably necessary to determine your claim. As consent is not the lawful basis on which we process your personal information, you cannot withdraw your consent to the processing of personal information if you wish to continue with your claim. However, you can withdraw your claim at any time before payment is made and, in those circumstances, we will only retain the small amount of personal information described in the section below titled ‘Storing your information’. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will use the personal information we collect only for the purpose of processing your application, to check on the level of service we provide and as otherwise required by law. We compile and publish statistics showing general information but not in a form which identifies anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-the-information-may-be-shared-with\"\u003eWho the information may be shared with\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to share the personal information we process with you and with other organisations. Where this is necessary we will comply with all aspects of data protection law. As well as members of our own staff, we have to disclose your identity and details of your application to the police (and, in some cases, prosecuting authorities) to obtain information we need to assess the application. This will include getting details of any criminal convictions held by you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will usually also have to disclose your identity and some application details to your doctor or other health professionals and obtain from them sufficient evidence of your injuries to allow us to assess what level of compensation should be awarded. This can include medical records from your GP and/or other treating practitioners and the commission of expert medical or psychological reports. In most cases you will be expected to provide this evidence but in some circumstances we may obtain it on your behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe may also need to share details of your application with other third parties, such as your employer, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs, or another relevant government department, local authority, or agency. We may also use fraud prevention agencies for the purposes of verifying your identity and preventing crime, fraud and money laundering. Such disclosures will be made in accordance with data protection law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"storing-your-information\"\u003eStoring your information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will keep personal information contained in our case files in line with our retention policy. This means that information relating to an application will be retained for a designated number of years from the date of closure. The precise length of time depends on the nature of the application. Routine case files will normally be held for 3 years from the date the application is finalised or, if the application relates to a child, until the child turns 21.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur legal functions require us to retain some personal information on each application beyond the destruction date. This is necessary so that we can identify duplicate applications, prevent fraud, and assess any request that is made to re-open an application on medical grounds or where the applicant has subsequently died of their injuries. The data we retain includes your name, address, date of birth, incident date, case reference and case outcome. As our lawful basis is the performance of a public task, the right to erasure does not apply and we are unable to destroy this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"our-telephone-service\"\u003eOur telephone service\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe offer a telephone service to those who want to apply over the phone or tell us about a development in their claim. Telephone calls to our Customer Support Team are recorded and kept for 120 days. Call recordings may be used for monitoring and staff training purposes during that period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have an existing claim, we will add a written summary of the telephone call to your case file where it will be stored in line with our retention policy described above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe may also seek user feedback to help us develop our telephone service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-our-digital-service-uses-cookies\"\u003eHow our digital service uses cookies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.

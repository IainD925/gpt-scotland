In these areas, a coordinated approach is appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/homes-for-ukraine-sponsor-guides\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance for sponsors\u003c/a\u003e makes it clear that prospective sponsors will be subject to accommodation and welfare checks .\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils must make at least one in-person visit prior to the arrival of guests wherever possible and we have asked councils to confirm that they have checked that the accommodation exists as part of their data return to the Department. The cost of checks should not be passed to the sponsor or guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recognise that the sponsor scheme is a unique arrangement that is seeing people open up their homes in response to an international crisis. Accommodation checks should be proportionate to this, and we ask councils to take a common sense approach. Councils have full discretion on the approach they take to accommodation checks and the judgements they make during these visits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe advise councils to check the accommodation is suitable for the number and profile of people intending to live in it, with access to adequate facilities, and that there are no serious safety issues, such as gas or electrical hazards. The Local Government Association has produced emerging \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/communities/refugees-and-asylum-seekers/ukraine-council-information/homes-ukraine-lessons\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egood practice examples and resources\u003c/a\u003e that councils may find useful in this context, and will be working to support councils as they take this work forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSponsors have been asked to check that their accommodation is suitable, which means it should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebe kept clean and in a reasonable state\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehave adequate kitchen and bathroom space\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehave access to drinking water\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehave a working smoke detector on each floor of the property and other fire safety precautions suitable for the building, for example fire doors or escape routes as appropriate.

However, councils may consider any factors they deem relevant in order to assess whether accommodation is suitable, enabling flexibility at a local level to deal with individual cases on their merits. Councils continue to retain powers and duties set out in the Housing Act 2004. This guidance does not replace or affect that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils may use their discretion in determining the appropriate approach to undertaking these checks. Where possible, councils are encouraged to conduct an initial check of the accommodation before a guest arrives, except for in the case of a rematch, when the checks must take place in advance of move-in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-a-guest-has-additional-care-or-support-needs\"\u003eIf a guest has additional care or support needs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the guest’s arrival, councils should confirm as soon as possible that the guest is well and that there are no serious safeguarding or welfare concerns or needs for care and support. Where it is suspected that the adult may have care and support needs, a needs assessment should be undertaken in line with the requirements of the Care Act 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf, on checking the accommodation, a council decides that it is unsafe or unsuitable, we recommend that they speak with the owner of the property about changes that could be made to remedy any issues before deeming the property unsuitable. Again, this should be based on a pragmatic approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government would encourage councils to support sponsors – particularly those that do not usually house guests or let out their property to tenants - to bring their properties to an appropriate standard where possible, for example, by working with the Fire Service to supply additional smoke alarms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCouncils retain the discretion to use their enforcement powers to require that issues be remedied if they judge that this is necessary and proportionate. For example, councils could undertake a risk assessment using the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and use their range of enforcement powers. Examples include hazard awareness notices and improvement notices. We encourage councils to only report the unsuitability of accommodation in the case management system (CMS) once they are content that the issue cannot or will not be remedied by the sponsor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-the-sponsor-doesnt-rent-their-accommodation\"\u003eIf the sponsor doesn’t rent their accommodation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere no rent is being paid by the sponsor of the accommodation, and since no rent is payable by the guest under the scheme (nor does the thank you payment constitute ‘other consideration’), councils are not expected to require such accommodation to obtain a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence, whether mandatory or additional (per the HMO definition in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/254\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 254 (2)(e) of the Housing Act 2004\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-the-sponsor-rents-their-accommodation\"\u003eIf the sponsor rents their accommodation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the sponsor is themselves paying rent for the accommodation being offered under the scheme, such as a tenant renting in the private rented sector, the property may be in scope of additional or mandatory HMO licensing schemes in operation in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA tenant offering a spare room is already advised to seek their landlord’s consent before doing so. The landlord can consider whether they are happy to approve of the arrangement, including whether this may bring them within scope of HMO licensing in their local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere accommodation is in scope of selective licensing, councils should take a pragmatic approach in recognition of the unique nature of the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"work-linked-sponsorship\"\u003eWork-linked sponsorship\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities should take steps to undertake safeguarding checks of all HFU visa holders, including those arriving to take up pre-arranged employment and where accommodation is provided on farms. For this cohort, local authorities should be checking that the offered accommodation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis suitable for the guest and their household, including for any children\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehas been offered for a minimum period of 6 months\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehas been offered free of any obligation to work\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis rent free. No deductions should be made from the National Minimum Wage in lieu of rent.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe post-arrival welfare check should be used to confirm that these conditions are met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere these criteria are met, the sponsorship arrangement should be recognised and thank you payments should be made in line with existing thank you payment guidance. Local authorities should undertake further periodic checks to assess their welfare particularly where children are accommodated, and to ensure that rent has not become payable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf local authorities are not satisfied that these criteria are met, or the accommodation is otherwise unsuitable for the occupant, the accommodation should be marked as unsuitable on CMS. No thank you payment should be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) should be alerted to any concerns around employment conditions experienced by arrivals in regulated employment sectors, including the agricultural sector. See \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gla.gov.uk/report-issues/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003einformation on how to report concerns\u003c/a\u003e.

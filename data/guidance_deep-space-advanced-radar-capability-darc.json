DARC will enable detection, identification, and tracking of objects in Earth orbit. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is proposing to house the UK DARC site at the former Cawdor Barracks in Pembrokeshire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVP1cNJQydk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK Space Command: Keeping space safe, secure, and sustainable\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-darc\"\u003eAbout DARC\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDARC will form the cornerstone of the UK’s ability to detect, identify and track objects in Earth orbit, including satellites, space debris, and asteroids. This is essential for ensuring our continued ability to safely and securely operate space-based services including satellites which are used for navigation, weather forecasting, and communication. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of three sites for DARC (in the UK, US and Australia) will enable 360 degree coverage of the sky at all times of day and under any weather conditions. The UK’s contribution to this project is therefore crucial to its success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MOD is proposing to house the main UK contribution to DARC at the Cawdor Barracks site in Pembrokeshire. This would see the site remain operational beyond the original planned closure date of 2028 and would support the local community by offering access to well-paid jobs and opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"mod-proposal-for-the-cawdor-barracks-site\"\u003eMOD proposal for the Cawdor Barracks site\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll MOD projects follow a strict planning and environmental assurance process, agreed with the local Council, to ensure that proposed facilities are safe and suitable for use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MOD has already begun a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment for the proposed redevelopment of Cawdor Barracks. This includes a Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment to ensure that the DARC project has a minimal impact on the local skyline.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese documents will be submitted to Pembrokeshire County Council as part of the planning process. Their approval will be conditional on demonstration that DARC has met all required safety and environmental impact standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-non-ionising-radiation\"\u003eWhat is non-ionising radiation?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDARC will bounce radio waves off objects in space to detect, track, and characterise them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio waves used by DARC are non-ionising radiation. They are not hazardous to health because they do not have enough energy to cause harmful ionisation. Radio waves are used in a wide variety of household devices including mobile phones, WiFi and GPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, MOD safety processes will ensure that DARC meets or exceeds international environmental and health standards for non-ionising radiation including those set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLevels of non-ionising radiation in the area surrounding the DARC site would be less than or equal to that received from using a mobile phone, presenting no danger to members of the public in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"public-engagement\"\u003ePublic engagement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MOD will work with the local community and Pembrokeshire County Council throughout the planning and proposed construction and operations of the DARC facility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo public information events were held in September 2024 prior to the statutory consultation period (which will take place in 2025).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link\"\u003e\n  \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66e7eb7ce47cfc6de429d74f/DARC_Proposal_at_Cawdor_Barracks.pdf\"\u003eDARC Proposal at Cawdor Barracks\u003c/a\u003e  (\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e3.22 MB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment-link__attribute\"\u003e13 pages\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"related-information\"\u003eRelated information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-space-strategy\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Space Strategy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-space-strategy-operationalising-the-space-domain\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDefence Space Strategy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-deep-space-radar-will-transform-uk-security\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNew deep space radar will transform UK security\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

We have to take time to support each other and find ways to look after our mental health.

By pulling together and taking simple steps each day, we can all be better prepared for the times ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have long been advocates for mental health, through their respective patronages and The Royal Foundation’s Heads Together campaign.

NHS Mental Health providers are also establishing 24/7 helplines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMind will use their existing links with other charities, including grassroots, user-led organisations, to reach vulnerable groups who are at particular risk during this period. This is expected to include older adults, people with an underlying health condition and anyone experiencing unstable employment and housing conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Farmer, chief executive of Mind and co-ordinating a group of mental health charities, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eWe are facing one of the toughest ever times for our mental wellbeing as a nation. It is absolutely vital that people pull together and do all they can to look after themselves and their loved ones, when we are all facing a huge amount of change and uncertainty. Reaching out to friends and family is critical, as well as paying attention to the impact our physical health can have on our mental health - from diet and exercise to getting enough natural light and a little fresh air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eCharities like Mind have a role to play in helping people cope not only with the initial emergency but coming to terms with how this will affect us well into the future.

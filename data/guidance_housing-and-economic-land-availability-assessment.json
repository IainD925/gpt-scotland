It is the role of the assessment to provide information on the range of sites which are available to meet the local authority’s (or, where relevant, elected Mayor or combined authority) requirements, but it is for the development plan itself to determine which of those sites are the most suitable to meet those requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlan-making authorities may carry out land availability assessments for housing and economic development as part of the same exercise, in order that sites may be identified for the use(s) which is most appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn assessment should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#Identification-of-sites-and-broad-locations\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eidentify sites and broad locations with potential for development\u003c/a\u003e;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#sitebroad-location-assessment\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eassess their development potential\u003c/a\u003e; and\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#factors-sitesbroad-locations-developed\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eassess their suitability for development and the likelihood of development coming forward (the availability and achievability)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance should be read in conjunction with separate \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ensuring-the-vitality-of-town-centres\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on the application of town centre planning policy\u003c/a\u003e, which includes the sequential test for locating town centre use as well as guidance on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/effective-use-of-land\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003emaking the most effective use of land\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 001 Reference ID: 3-001-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"should-plan-makers-override-constraints-such-as-green-belt-when-carrying-out-the-assessment-to-meet-identified-needs\"\u003eShould plan-makers override constraints, such as Green Belt, when carrying out the assessment to meet identified needs?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlan-making bodies should consider constraints when assessing the suitability, availability and achievability of sites and broad locations.

If there is clear evidence that strategic policies cannot meet the needs of the area, factoring in the constraints, it will be important to establish how needs might be met in adjoining areas through the process of preparing \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-making#maintaining-effective-cooperation\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estatements of common ground\u003c/a\u003e, and in accordance with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/duty-to-cooperate\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eduty to cooperate\u003c/a\u003e.

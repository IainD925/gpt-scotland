For some, like those experiencing domestic abuse, being at home can be a terrifying experience and for others it can be very isolating as they are cut off from the friends and social networks they rely on to keep well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some practical steps you can take to ensure your employees’ mental health isn’t negatively impacted when working from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"build-in-time-for-regular-communication\"\u003eBuild in time for regular communication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEncourage structured check ins with team members, either one-to-one or as a group.

Video calls can be more engaging, efficient and personal but remember they can also be tiring if individuals have a lot of them throughout the day. Think carefully about the duration of calls and leaving enough time for people to take breaks. Make sure all employees have the right equipment to do their job well and to stay connected with you and their wider team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVideo platforms can be very inclusive, but if you’ve started using them recently, you should be sure to ensure everyone has access to training and support, so that everyone has the same level of confidence to use them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"be-flexible-to-suit-employee-needs\"\u003eBe flexible to suit employee needs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to recognise that all your employees may be working in different circumstances, potentially caring for children or other family members and/or home schooling. This may lead to interruptions during meetings, or the need to take extended time away from their workstation during the day. Accepting these disturbances actively lets employees know that you understand their situation, and takes any additional pressure off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere possible, consider making adjustments to working hours.

Without this, employees may start to feel overwhelmed, or overtired if they work additional hours to compensate. Foster a culture with individuals and among the team to build in recovery time so hours of work are manageable and restoration of capacity can be enabled so work is sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"encourage-healthy-behaviours\"\u003eEncourage healthy behaviours\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEating a balanced diet, maintaining a routine and taking regular breaks are some ways that your employees can take care of their mental and physical health.

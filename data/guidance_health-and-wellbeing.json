Local Planning Authorities should consider seeking details from applicants, setting out what measures will be put in place to reduce the litter associated with a proposed development, to ensure there is no unacceptable impact from litter on the amenity of the area. Details can include proposals to install litter bins, commitments to undertake litter picking and advisory signage. Litter generated from such premises may be deposited away from the immediate vicinity of the premises. Councils can consider the wider effect this has on local amenity – such as by asking for premises to undertake litter picking to collect litter (generated from off-sales from that premises) which has been deposited further away from the immediate vicinity.

For example, section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 empowers Local Planning Authorities to require owners/occupiers tidy up a site if it is adversely affecting the amenity of the neighbourhood.

They should, at the most appropriate level, allocate sufficient suitable land for schools to meet the need anticipated over the plan period, taking into account needs that may cross local authority boundaries.  Plan-makers will need to work with local authorities with education responsibilities and developers to coordinate the phasing and delivery of housing growth with the delivery of new school places to ensure that sufficient school capacity is available at the right time.  Mainstream schools must be of a viable size and format and planned for on the basis of standard class sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrecise site allocation policies provide clarity and certainty by identifying the total amount of land required for education use, with regard to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mainstream-schools-area-guidelines/area-planning-for-maintained-schools\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDepartment for Education space standards\u003c/a\u003e, and any necessary characteristics for the school site such as its shape, accessibility and serviced provision at an appropriate time.

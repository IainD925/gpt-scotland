Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.1 This document sets out the conditions (the conditions) for all organisations on the register (the register) of end-point assessment organisations (EPAOs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.2 The purpose of the conditions set out in this document is to ensure that all EPAOs are clear about the requirements which we (the Education and Skills Funding Agency) have implemented to ensure that public funding and apprentice needs are protected. Only registered EPAOs are eligible to receive public funding in connection with end-point assessment (EPA) activities. In the event of any conflict between the conditions set out in this document and any other documents produced by us relating to EPA, this document takes priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.3 We ask that you (the organisation applying to the register) read and ensure you fully understand the conditions set out in this document before you start your application to the register. For organisations on the register before we published these conditions, we will apply them from 1 December 2017 and they will cover the standard(s) you are registered to assess against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.4 The conditions are set out below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-organisational-details\"\u003e2. Your organisational details\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.1 The application process guides you through the requirements you must meet to be registered as an EPAO. You will need to continue to meet these requirements to remain on the register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.2 The information you give us at the time of your application to the register must remain current and valid. Should there be any significant change in this information which reasonably impacts on your ability to deliver EPA you must inform us immediately at \u003ca href=\"mailto:helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehelpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e. Depending on the nature of that change, we will review your listing on the register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.3 Significant changes in information covers all the areas in the application form, which would affect your ability to deliver EPA for the standard(s) and assessment plan(s) you are registered to assess against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis includes, but is not limited to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echanges in your financial health (unless you are exempt from financial audit)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echanges to your organisational structure that affect the delivery of the EPA\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echanges to your overall resources to deliver EPA for a specific standard and its assessment plan\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einformation that you are now subject to a formal investigation, sanction or other form of penalty from any other organisation or government agency (this does not include generic regulatory activities that you may be subject to)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echanges to the contact information or web links that we hold about you on the register publication on GOV.UK\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.4 You must notify the external quality assurance (EQA) body for the relevant standard immediately if you become aware of any:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einstance of assessment malpractice\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eincident which could compromise your ability to deliver EPA reliably and independently\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einstance that could cause you to fail to comply with the requirements of the published standard and its assessment plan\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.5 We ask you annually to re-confirm the details of your application in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assessors.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eApprenticeship assessment service\u003c/a\u003e. We will notify you in advance and you must comply with our request within four working weeks of receiving the notification. This may include a check of the information we publish about you on the register, and your organisation’s financial health assessment. At least once every three years we will ask you to re-confirm assessment and occupational capacity and capability details. We will require you to validate, update and resubmit these application details to us through the Apprenticeship assessment service for the standard(s) and assessment plans you are registered to assess against. We will give you advance notice of when we intend to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"readiness\"\u003e3. Readiness\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.1 In stage 2 of your application we need you to indicate when you will be ready to begin to deliver your EPA services in line with the requirements set out in the standard(s) and assessment plan you are applying against. While we expect that this should generally not exceed nine months of your registration for each standard you have applied against; we are aware that, for some standards EPA might not take place for a significant period of time, for instance two to three years. In addition, depending on the EQA body for the standard (also referred to as EQA providers or EQAPs), there may be other readiness requirements you need to take into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.2 As a result, readiness in the context of these conditions means that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ewithin nine months of your registration you must have in place the necessary administrative and systems infrastructure and associated internal quality assurance policies and procedures to support your end to-end EPA service. You should also have a starting base of assessor resource. This means you should be able to support meaningful engagement with employers to offer EPA services and that you are able to support them, and their apprentices, to understand and prepare for the end-point activity\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ewhere you registered against a standard which is between 12 and 24 months’ duration (or where, as a result of prior learning the duration for individual apprentices has been shortened to between 12 and 24 months), you must also have all EPA support materials in place within nine months of your registration and final assessment instruments and tools ready three months in advance of the first EPA taking place, unless there is a requirement from your EQA body that these should be available earlier\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ewhere you have registered for a standard which is above 24 months’ duration you must also have all EPA support materials in place within twelve months of your registration and final assessment instruments and tools ready three months in advance of the first EPA taking place, unless there is a requirement from your EQA body that these should be available earlier. This rule can also be applied to newly published standards and integrated degrees. Newly published standards are defined as those approved for delivery no longer than 6 months before you are applying for them\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.3 We understand that in some circumstances you may not be able to deliver EPA in the above timeframes. This could be due to EQA requirements, or due to amendments to the standard or assessment plan. If you find you are not ready within the original time scale you indicated, you must inform us immediately at \u003ca href=\"mailto:helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehelpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e including the reasons for the delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.4 We will notify the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) and the relevant EQA body of your intended readiness date. Shortly before the date you have indicated you will be ready to deliver EPA, the relevant EQA body will undertake a short audit to test your readiness before delivery can begin. If you wish to bring the readiness date forward please inform us through the helpdesk at \u003ca href=\"mailto:helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehelpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e. Once the change has been made we will share this with the EQA body. Contact the EQA body if you require further information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe audit will cover:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edevelopment of assessment materials\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erecruitment of assessors\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eEPA delivery plans\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esupport materials\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einternal quality assurance systems\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.5 Readiness to deliver is about you directly delivering EPA. You must not contract out EPA to another organisation to deliver on your behalf (although you may use contracted assessors who may be self-employed or drawn from other organisations to support your delivery of EPA). However, you are solely accountable and responsible for the EPA for the standard(s) and assessment plan(s) you are registered to assess against and you must deliver the EPA in line with the requirements set out in the assessment plan(s) you are registered to assess against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.6 In order to be ready to deliver EPA you must demonstrate that you are meeting the requirements set out for the EPAO in the standard and assessment plan (for example, preparation of test banks, supporting materials or assessor qualifications). You must also meet any requirements set out for the standard by the EQA body and/or relevant regulatory bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.7 Once you meet your readiness date indicated in your register application your entry will be included on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFind an EPAO\u003c/a\u003e service. If sufficient progress towards readiness is not being made, we may delay your publication on the service and ask you to agree a revised readiness date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3.8 You must ensure you are responsive to requests for updates on your ability to deliver assessments for the standards you are approved for. If you do not respond to requests for information from the ESFA, your EQA body, employers or providers, we may review your position on the register using the following process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eif you are unresponsive to requests for information from the ESFA, EQA body, employers or providers, we will write to you to clarify if you wish to remain on the register\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eif you remain unresponsive we will write to you giving 14 days from the date of our correspondence to respond with the reasons why you should not be removed from the register.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eif a reply is not received within 14 days a final letter will be sent giving 14 days’ notice of removal from the register\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"promotion-and-selection\"\u003e4. Promotion and selection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.1 While we encourage you to directly promote your EPA service to employers, you must only do this once you are approved for the register and only for the standard(s) you are registered to assess against. As part of promoting yourself to employers, you must also make clear what your position is in relation to your readiness to deliver a full end-to-end EPA service. After you tell us when you will be ready to conduct your first assessment, you will be searchable on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efind an end-point assessment organisation\u003c/a\u003e service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.2 If you are already listed on the register you may indicate, through your promotional activities, your intention to apply for further standards, but you must make clear that you are not yet registered to assess against these standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.3 You must not promote your EPA service as an undifferentiated part of any package of broader services you may offer to an employer or apprenticeship training provider, including as part of an undifferentiated package of services linked to on-programme qualifications and/or delivery. While you may promote a range of services, and may do this through a single source, you must be clear that your EPA service is a separate and independent offer and costs will be separately charged for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.4 Once contractual agreement is in place we have required training providers to record the selected EPAO in the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) for each apprentice once the identity of the EPAO is known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4.5 Where you have been approached by a training provider to deliver EPA you should request details of the employer in order that you can meet with the employer and discuss and confirm arrangements for EPA directly. You may also need to inform your EQA body so that they can plan EQA activity and any charges due.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligible-costs\"\u003e5. Eligible costs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.1 The employer will select you and negotiate and agree a price with you for EPA. The price agreed will include only those items identified as eligible costs as set out in paragraph 5.7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.2 Eligible costs should not usually exceed 20% of the funding band maximum for the standard. This does not mean that EPA must always cost 20%. The price an individual employer will pay for EPA will vary across standards and across EPAOs. In your negotiation with employers you must bear in mind the need to secure value for money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.3 Where the total cost of assessment (and training) agreed is higher than the funding band maximum the employer must pay the difference. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe apprenticeship funding and performance management rules\u003c/a\u003e contain further information on the rules which apply to all apprenticeship provision funded by us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.4 Payment from the employer to you is routed through the training provider. In order to receive payment, you and the training provider must have a form of contract agreed and in place as soon as possible after notification of your selection by the employer. This contract must cover roles and responsibilities and a schedule for the channelling of funding through the provider to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.5 The terms of the contract between you and the training provider also need to be clear that you are delivering the EPA on behalf of the employer and that the training provider is acting as our agent in passing the payment (either from the employer’s apprenticeship service levy account or funded by us) that you are due through to you. This does not make you a delivery subcontractor of the training provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.6 You must base the costs you quote and or charge for the service you provide including the administration and delivery of EPA (eligible costs) and may also comprise an element linked to profit. As part of arriving at these costs you may take wider business overhead costs into account. These costs may change over time depending on business need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.7 Eligible costs are costs:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated with the administration, registration and examination of EPA as set out in the standard(s), and their assessment plan(s), you are registered to assess against\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated with providing guidance and support and the materials (non-capital items) used in the delivery of EPA (equipment or supplies necessary to enable the assessment to take place)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated with ensuring trained staff and appropriate premises are available to deliver EPA\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated with the development and maintenance of assessment instruments and tools\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto support any special arrangements you may need to put in place to ensure any apprentices with special educational needs, disabilities or with another temporary or permanent debilitating condition can fairly access EPA\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated with any further assessment required by the apprentice to achieve EPA (for instance retakes or resits)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eassociated with ensuring consistent and robust internal quality assurance (for instance moderation and standardisation of assessment instruments and tools, assessors and assessment decisions)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eincluding any EQA charges you may incur (please refer to paragraphs in section 11)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.8 Ineligible costs are costs associated with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany centre approval process (while you will need to assure yourself that the provider has appropriate systems and processes in place for presenting apprentices for EPA, you should not charge for this)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe recruitment and continuing professional development of your assessors\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epromotional activity and or materials\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany on-programme activity you may offer; these costs must be separate as they are ineligible for EPA and must not be packaged as part of the EPA charges you make to an employer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.9. In addition, you must not directly or indirectly charge individual apprentices for any aspect of their EPA, for example, for materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.10 You must only charge the employer (through the provider) for eligible costs that you legitimately incur as part of the actual administration and delivery of EPA. There may be occasions however, when you have incurred legitimate eligible costs, but due to unforeseen circumstances, an assessment has not been carried out. This may include apprentices who withdraw from attending a booked assessment. In such cases the reasonable eligible costs (i.e. those already incurred in arranging the assessment of the outstanding components) will be payable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.11. Similarly, you may incur costs based on anticipated numbers of apprentices and, through no fault of your own, the final number of apprentices undertaking EPA is fewer. In such cases there is no requirement for you to repay these costs on the basis that you have incurred them in good faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.12. If the cost of EPA is higher than the price originally quoted to the employer, you must renegotiate and agree revised costs with the employer before charging additional fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5.13 You agree that you may be subject to audit from us. Where this is the case we will give you notice of the intention to audit and clearly identify what is in scope for audit. You must be able to clearly account for and justify, with clear evidence of service delivered, all money you receive. If we have evidence that you have claimed money through the provider that you were not entitled to, then you must return those funds as directed by us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"conflict-and-collusion\"\u003e6. Conflict and collusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.1. You must make every effort to manage and mitigate any potential or real conflict of interest in the delivery of your EPA service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.2 Where a potential conflict emerges you must take appropriate action to ensure that the integrity and validity of the EPA you deliver is not compromised. This may mean, for instance, removing individuals from any involvement in the assessment process where there is a risk of conflict. The independence of your decision on the competency of the apprentice is paramount. Any actual or perceived conflict of interest can undermine both the outcome of the EPA and your credibility as a trusted assessor of apprentices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.3 As part of the application process for the register you have demonstrated that you have a conflict of interest policy in place and that you understand the requirements for separate and independent EPA. You must actively maintain and review your conflict of interest policy, recognising that you will need to respond to changes in what may constitute a potential or real conflict as you build relationships with employers and providers, expand your EPA offer to new standards and assessment plans and engage with EQA bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.4 Your conflict of interest policy must operate at an organisational as well as at individual assessor level, including any organisations and individuals with which you have contracted to support your delivery of EPA. You are ultimately accountable and responsible if we find evidence that there has been a conflict of interest for your organisation, with an individual assessor, group of assessors, employers, providers, apprentices or an EQA body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.5 While on the register you may also wish to offer on-programme support to providers. Where this is the case, there must be a clear separation between your on-programme support services (non-mandatory or mandatory on programme qualifications, provision of support materials for on-programme learning) and your EPA activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.6 It is possible for you to be listed on both the register of apprenticeship training providers and also the register of EPAOs. If this is the case, you must meet the respective entry criteria and requirements of both registers, ensure robust separation of your individual business offers (including how you manage them) and also ensure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere is a clear separation of individuals, processes, policies and roles and responsibilities between the training and the assessment arm of your organisation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eno individuals involved in on-programme delivery can be involved in EPA for the same individual or group of apprentices\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou do not deliver on-programme training and EPA for the same group of apprentices for the same standard (unless an exemption has been agreed or you are delivering both the programme and the EPA as part of an integrated degree apprenticeship)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.7 The separation described above also applies if your organisation has dual or multiple roles. For example, if you are a professional body which is also an awarding organisation and EPAO, there must be clear separation between these functions. Similarly, if you are an apprentice employer, who has been granted an exemption allowing you to assess your own apprentices through the relevant published assessment plan, there must be a clear separation between these functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.8 You must not collude with other EPAOs, providers, employers or any other organisation in the delivery of EPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.9 By collusion we mean you and another organisation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eentering the register with the express intention of delivering EPA to each other’s apprentices and or of circumventing the requirement both for the employer to select the EPAO and for separate and independent assessment\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ealready on the register entering into such reciprocal arrangements at a later stage\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.10 We will view such reciprocal arrangements as deliberate collusion which will not only undermine the independence of EPA but also limit open competition in the EPAO market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.11 You must not be party to or actively offer or accept incentives or inducements to or from employers and or providers in connection with your engagement to deliver EPA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e6.12 It is permissible to work with other organisations for the purposes of sourcing assessors. In such circumstances it is your responsibility to ensure any conflicts of interest are managed and it must be clear that whilst performing their assessor role, assessors are doing this on your behalf as the registered EPAO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"gateway-review\"\u003e7. Gateway review\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.1 Prior to undertaking their EPA, you must ensure that the apprentice has passed the gateway review. The employer conducts this review and is supported by the provider, who in turn will have a continuing duty of care for the apprentice as they undertake EPA. As part of the process of passing the gateway review, the employer must agree that the apprentice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eis in their view competent in the role and therefore ready to do the EPA\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehas achieved mandatory on-programme qualifications (where applicable)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehas achieved other specific requirements where these are listed in the assessment plan, such as completing a logbook or service record\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.2 You must not assess an apprentice who has not achieved all of the gateway requirements for their apprenticeship or where the rule for minimum duration has not been met. To ensure this is the case you must have in place a process for checking the requirements with the employer and provider and satisfying yourself that the apprentice has met all the requirements. This includes confirming that the apprentice has achieved eligible English and maths qualifications at the appropriate level (unless the apprentice has an exemption).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.3 Once gateway requirements have been satisfied you must deliver EPA in line with any timings and requirements set out in the assessment plan. Only in exceptional circumstances would we expect EPA to take place beyond any timings set out in the assessment plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.4 Apprentices may resit or retake elements of their EPA, in line with any requirements set out in the assessment plan. Any resit or retake should be agreed with the employer and training provider and take place within a reasonable timeframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e7.5 Where EPA has taken place and the apprentice has ‘failed’, this must be recorded in the apprenticeship service, and only once the apprentice has ‘passed’ must the certificate be claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"certification\"\u003e8.

The Education and Skills Funding Agency operate the process for issuing certificates on behalf of the Secretary of State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClaiming certificates\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.2 The apprenticeship certificate is the formal recognition that an individual has achieved their apprenticeship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.3 You must request the apprenticeship certificate from us once an apprentice has achieved all components of their EPA. As part of this, you must ensure that the apprentice has given their written permission for you to apply for certification on their behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.4 When we receive your request for the apprenticeship certificate we will cross-check the apprentice’s details, including the apprenticeship standard being certified, with the information we receive from providers in the ILR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.5 We understand that it may be helpful for the individual apprentice to have a record or summary of their performance through the components of EPA and you may wish to issue such a record to an apprentice. If you want to issue such a record you must make it clear that such a record is not instead of the actual apprenticeship certificate and you must not charge either the apprentice or the employer for it (or make any charge to the provider).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8.6 You must not issue your own ‘apprenticeship certificate’. Any record of results you do issue to the apprentice on completion of their EPA must include a statement that makes clear such a record is not a formal apprenticeship certificate. You must ensure that any details of results you include in this record are for EPA and not for the overall apprenticeship. Where we find this happening we will treat this as a significant breach of these conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"record-keeping\"\u003e9. Record keeping\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e9.1 For audit purposes, you must retain a record to prove you have seen and checked evidence that the apprentice has achieved the English and maths qualification requirements and that you are satisfied all other gateway requirements have been met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e9.2 You must retain information about the EPAs undertaken and payment received for six years after the activity took place. This is for audit purposes and so that you can respond to any complaints or appeals from apprentices. This should include details of what assessments were undertaken, against which versions of the standard and assessment plan, when and by whom, along with assessment outcomes and evidence of the internal quality assurance of those assessments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"monitoring-and-audit\"\u003e10.

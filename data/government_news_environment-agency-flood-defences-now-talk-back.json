The QR code is mounted on them or nearby in 4 locations, with a fifth to be added later this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLiz Taylor, flood resilience engagement advisor, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eFinding new and interesting ways to engage people is key. And using Hello Lamp Post technology will help make us more relevant to a newer audience who prefer texting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eBut the advice being shared through our growing network is relevant to everyone. How to stay safe in a flood. How defences work. And ways to start making lifestyle changes to cut down on plastic waste from our in-house team of experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe also hope to add advice on saving water from South West Water in the future.

Since they have been installed the number of interactions is the equivalent of holding around 40 public engagement events. They have helped us save nearly 5 tonnes of carbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe next location to be added is East Budleigh where people can find out more about the Lower Otter Restoration Project.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

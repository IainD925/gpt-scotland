As part of their plan-making process, local planning authorities should undertake a housing need assessment to take into account the need for a range of housing types and tenures, including various affordable housing tenures (such as First Homes). Specific demographic data is available on open data communities which can be used to inform this process. The assessment will enable an evidence-based planning judgement to be made about the need for a higher minimum discount level in the area, and how it can meet the needs of different demographic and social groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn such circumstances, the minimum discount level should be fixed at either 40% or 50% below market value and should not be set at any other value. In each case, these percentages represent the minimum discount required for a home to qualify as a First Home. Developers who are able to offer higher discounts within their contributions should be free to do so but the local authority cannot require this. In such cases, whatever discount (as a percentage of market value) is given at the first disposal should be the same at each subsequent sale. These minimum discounts should apply to the entire local plan area (except if Neighbourhood Plans are in place in certain areas) and should not be changed on a site-by-site basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf local authorities or neighbourhood planning groups choose to revise their required minimum discounts in any future alterations to their plans, this should not affect the minimum discounts required for previously sold First Homes when they come to be resold, as these will be bound by the section 106 agreements entered into at the time of their first sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 004 Reference ID: 70-004-20210524\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-the-price-cap-be-changed\"\u003eCan the price cap be changed?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to qualify as a First Home, the initial sale of the home cannot be at a price greater than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London) after the discount has been applied.

Whilst the national standard price caps will be high for many local areas across England, homes built as First Homes will need to be of appropriate size and price for first-time buyers in any area.

This may involve lower income caps (if this can be justified with reference to local average first-time buyer incomes), a local connection test, or criteria based on employment status. First Homes are designed to allow people to get on the housing ladder in their local area, and in particular to ensure that key workers providing essential services are able to buy homes in the areas where they work. Authorities can therefore prioritise key workers for First Homes, and are encouraged to do so, especially if they have an identified local need for certain professions. The definition of a key worker should be determined locally and could be any person who works in any profession that is considered essential for the functioning of a local area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal connections may include (but are not limited to) current residency, employment requirements, family connections or special circumstances, such as caring responsibilities.

Income caps should not be set at a level which would prevent a borrower from obtaining a 95% loan-to-value mortgage for the discounted price of suitable properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny local eligibility criteria will apply for a maximum of 3 months from when a home is first marketed.

Local planning authorities are also encouraged to make the development requirements for First Homes clear for their area. The most appropriate method or tool to do this will depend on individual circumstances for each local planning authority. These might include (but may not be limited to): publication of an interim policy statement, or updating relevant local plan policies. Local planning authorities should assess their own circumstances when considering the most appropriate way to achieve this in their context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 009 Reference ID: 70-009-20210524\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"disapplying-the-first-homes-criteria-and-eligibility-criteria\"\u003eDisapplying the First Homes criteria and eligibility criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-the-mortgagee-exclusion-clause\"\u003eWhat is the Mortgagee Exclusion Clause?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA Mortgagee Exclusion Clause should be present in all planning obligations which secure the delivery of First Homes, to ensure appropriate protection for lenders and encourage competitive lending rates. In its \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-homes-model-section-106-agreement-for-developer-contributions\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003etemplate planning obligations\u003c/a\u003e, the government has set out an exemplar Mortgagee Exclusion Clause and, in the interest of consistency, it is strongly recommended that local authorities use this example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mortgagee Exclusion Clause ensures that a regulated financial institution which has provided the finance necessary to support the purchase of a First Home (the Mortgagee) is not bound by the requirement to sell the home under the First Homes criteria to a person meeting the First Homes eligibility criteria in the event that they are enforcing their security against the property. The Mortgagee Exclusion Clause should provide that, in the event of the Mortgagee enforcing their security against the property, the property can be sold to anyone on the open market at open market value and the property will cease to be a First Home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mortgagee Exclusion Clause should require that, once the Mortgagee has recovered the funds due to them under the security documentation, any remaining proceeds from the sale should be used to reimburse the local authority for the loss of the First Home from their area. This reimbursement should be up to (but should not exceed) the value of the discount, as a percentage of the sale price and net of any additional Stamp Duty liability that may be incurred from the sale by the seller. If the remaining proceeds from the sale of the property are not sufficient to cover the total percentage value of the discount, then all of the remaining proceeds should be transferred to the relevant authority. Further detail on how this should be calculated, including worked examples and further detail on when additional Stamp Duty liability may be incurred, will be published and appended to this Guidance in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the Mortgagee has recovered their investment and the local authority has received the full amount owned to them as a percentage of the sale value of the home, any remaining profits from the sale should be returned to the home owner from whom the Mortgagee took possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 010 Reference ID: 70-010-20211223\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date 23 12 2021\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"aside-from-the-mortgagee-exclusion-clause-can-a-property-identified-as-a-first-home-ever-be-sold-without-the-first-homes-restrictions\"\u003eAside from the Mortgagee Exclusion Clause, can a property identified as a First Home ever be sold without the First Homes restrictions?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that agreements to secure First Homes do not prevent homes from being sold for a long period and there may be circumstances where a suitable buyer for a First Home cannot be found, even when the local restrictions have been removed. Therefore, a local authority should include provisions in a section 106 agreement which allow a developer or First Home owner to sell a First Home on the open market and remove the title restriction, as long as certain conditions are met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf such provisions are included, it should be expected that the seller (either the developer or a future First Home owner) compensates the relevant Authority for the loss of the affordable housing unit. As with the Mortgagee Exclusion Clause, this compensation should be the value of the discount the First Home was to be sold for, as a percentage of the final sale price (or, as much as possible of that value once the value of all lending against the property has been cleared) and net of any additional Stamp Duty liability incurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere should also be a requirement, within the agreement, that the home is marketed for at least 6 months in total and that all reasonable steps have been taken to sell the property (including, where appropriate, reducing the asking price).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 011 Reference ID: 70-011-20210524\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"plan--and-decision-making\"\u003ePlan- and Decision-Making\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"setting-developer-contributions-for-first-homes\"\u003eSetting developer contributions for First Homes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-should-developer-contributions-be-secured-for-first-homes\"\u003eHow should developer contributions be secured for First Homes?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA minimum of 25% of all affordable housing units secured through developer contributions should be First Homes.

The plan viability assessment should set out assumptions on the amount of value captured – for example, a social rent home may be discounted by 50% from market value, and a shared ownership home may be discounted by 20%.

Article 9 of the same regulation classifies manure as a category 2 Animal by-product (\u003cabbr title=\"animal by-product\"\u003eABP\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSolid and liquid waste may be handled differently. Therefore for the purpose of this guidance the term ‘manure’ is used to refer to solid waste and ‘slurry’ for liquid waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Animal and Plant Health Agency (\u003cabbr title=\"Animal and Plant Health Agency\"\u003eAPHA\u003c/abbr\u003e) is responsible for enforcing the \u003cabbr title=\"animal by-product\"\u003eABP\u003c/abbr\u003e regulation. In the event that \u003cabbr title=\"Animal and Plant Health Agency\"\u003eAPHA\u003c/abbr\u003e identifies a risk to human or animal health associated with manure or slurry, there may be specific control measures to be put in place. These are usually applied in relation to notifiable disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf \u003cabbr title=\"Animal and Plant Health Agency\"\u003eAPHA\u003c/abbr\u003e does not consider there to be a risk of spreading any serious, transmissible disease, manure can be applied to land without processing, (Authorisation B1). However, the following options for manure management are recommended as best practice and should be adopted wherever possible to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance may be of particular relevance on farms where antibiotic resistance in zoonotic bacteria such as E.coli, Salmonella or Campylobacter has been identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find Authorisation B1 and more information in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/derogations-from-the-animal-by-product-controls-under-regulation-ec-1069-2009-and-commission-regulation-eu-142-2011\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAnimal by-products legislation for England: exemptions\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther guidance is provided by the Food Standards Agency (\u003cabbr title=\"Food Standards Agency\"\u003eFSA\u003c/abbr\u003e) regarding the spread of waste on land used to grow ready to eat crops such as salad leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"recommended-management-options\"\u003eRecommended management options\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"stacking-and-storage-of-manure\"\u003eStacking and storage of manure\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacking of manure helps to reduce the number of bacteria, which could present a danger to public or animal health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is recommended that manure is stacked for a period of 8 weeks. Once the stack is formed, no further manure should be added to the stack for the entire 8 week period. The manure stack should be sited so as to prevent livestock gaining access. If possible, the stack should be sited on hard standing and covered once formed, to prevent access by wildlife (including birds).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the 8 week period the manure can be spread on land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"composting-of-manure\"\u003eComposting of manure\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManure can be sent for composting at a designated facility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComposting is the biological degradation of organic material in the presence of air and water and the process will help to destroy bacteria harboured in the manure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no requirement to use an \u003cabbr title=\"animal by-product\"\u003eABP\u003c/abbr\u003e-approved composting plant for the disposal of manure (unlike other materials such as food waste).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"storage-of-slurry\"\u003eStorage of slurry\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the farm has adequate storage capacity, it is recommended that the slurry is held for a period of 3 months prior to spreading on land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this 3 month holding period no further slurry is to be added. This may be more feasible where 2 slurry tanks are available on farm, so that one can be filled while the second is used for storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"anaerobic-digestion-of-slurry-and-manure\"\u003eAnaerobic digestion of slurry and manure\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth slurry and manure can be sent to an anaerobic digestion plant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnaerobic digestion is the biological digestion of organic material in the absence of oxygen for the production and collection of biogas. The biogas, mainly methane, is collected to be used as a fuel. The remaining material (digestate) is then spread as fertiliser. The process destroys bacteria and is considered to be the best approach for reducing spread of bacteria to the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no requirement to use an \u003cabbr title=\"animal by-product\"\u003eABP\u003c/abbr\u003e-approved anaerobic digestion site for the disposal of manure (unlike other materials such as food waste).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"points-to-consider-when-spreading-manure-or-slurry\"\u003ePoints to consider when spreading manure or slurry\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIt is good practice to stack solid manure until it is well rotted before use on land because fresh manure can harm some plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eTo reduce transmission of bacteria from manure to other animals, it is best practice to spread slurry or manure on arable land rather than pasture which will be grazed or cropped for animal feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIf manure or slurry is applied to grazing land (or land cropped for feed production), in order to reduce the risk of spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria to livestock, it is recommended that grazing or cropping does not take place for a period of at least 8 weeks. The longer the manure is exposed to ultra-violet light, other weathering effects, natural decomposition and the effect of worms taking material into the soil the less the risk from potentially harmful micro-organisms will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eInjecting slurry rather than top spreading reduces the spread of resistance by reducing runoff and minimising wildlife exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIt is also advisable to take appropriate hygiene and bio-security precautions when spreading or handling manure, for example wearing outer clothing and waterproof footwear which can be cleaned and disinfected, wearing gloves, hand washing and ensuring that manure is not stored or treated anywhere near food crops which are eaten without cooking such as salads.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther guidance on environmental controls relating to land applications can be found in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sewage-sludge-in-agriculture-code-of-practice\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecode of practice for sewage sludge in agriculture\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"transport-requirements\"\u003eTransport requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAuthorisation D10 allows the transport of manure between 2 points located on the same farm or between farms and users of manure.

This is because the testes are an immune privileged site and thus are relatively protected from the immune responses that clear Ebola virus in convalescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not believed that ovaries are an immune privileged site in the same way and therefore prolonged persistence of Ebola virus in the female genital tract would not be anticipated, although this has not been proven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvidence also has shown that, although rare, subclinical or asymptomatic Ebola virus infection can occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"advisory-committee-on-dangerous-pathogens-acdp-recommendations\"\u003eAdvisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (\u003cabbr title=\"Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens\"\u003eACDP\u003c/abbr\u003e) recommendations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter consideration of this evidence, the Ebola Working Group of the \u003cabbr title=\"Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens\"\u003eACDP\u003c/abbr\u003e made the following recommendations on sperm or egg donation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ea lifetime ban on any gamete donation from known Ebola virus survivors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor those who are not known to have been infected with Ebola virus but who have been in an area of active Ebola virus transmission:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea 2 year deferral from treatment or donation for sperm donors or male fertility patients after leaving the affected area\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ea 6 month deferral from treatment or donation for egg donors and female fertility patients after leaving the affected area\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there are any concerns regarding patients undergoing fertility treatment or gamete donation and the risk of Ebola virus disease, further advice may be sought from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The application form submitted by applicants formed the main focus of each assessment, however applicants also submitted additional documentation. These documents were taken into consideration where appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInitial checks took place against the published criteria in the prospectus to ensure applications were: in scope, eligible and had provided sufficient information to carry out assessment. Bids were then assessed against the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-ownership-fund-round-3-application-form-assessment-criteria-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003epublished assessment framework\u003c/a\u003e (this was updated for R3). In order to be fundable, bids were required to meet benchmark minimum scores for both the management case and the strategic case. If an application did not meet the required standard on any part of the assessment, the assessment of that bid was ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComments from officials in the Offices for the Secretaries of States for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, formed part of the assessment process. The devolved administrations were  also given an opportunity to comment on bids from their respective nations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA process of moderation was then undertaken. Assessments selected for moderation comprised of a mix of low, borderline, and high scoring bids or particularly complex bids. Moderation panels discussed the approach to scoring each of the criteria to ensure that the assessment guidance had been applied fairly and consistently, amending any scores as necessary. In Round 1, due to this being the first round of assessment, MHCLG also sought the services of Local Partnerships and the Government Actuary Department to act as independent assurers to review and moderate assessments to ensure that the assessment criteria had been applied fairly across the assessment of all the bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDue diligence checks were undertaken. Organisations’ identity, governance arrangements and solvency were checked as part of this process, which also helped to detect and prevent fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing moderation, officials presented a shortlist of bids to Ministers which met the minimum criteria and were therefore considered fundable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"ministerial-decision-making\"\u003eMinisterial decision-making\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government was given advice with the shortlist of bids for a decision on which to fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State was given the option to apply the following 5 additional factors when considering the shortlist in order to select the final list for funding. These were to ensure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1. a balanced spread of location of projects across all parts of the United Kingdom\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2. a proportionate spread of the location of projects between rural and urban areas\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e3. a reasonable thematic split of asset types supported by the programme\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e4. a balance of organisation types who have applied, e.g., parishes vs community organisations\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e5. a balance between projects requiring large amounts of funding and those requiring small amounts\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters from HM Treasury and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport as well as the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Offices were also presented with the shortlist and given the opportunity to provide comments and advice, based on the same additional factors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters notified their respective Private Offices of any personal or pecuniary interests in relation to the Fund, and recused themselves as appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Round 1 the Secretary of State decided to place particular focus on ensuring there was a geographic spread of projects across the United Kingdom. The ministers from HM Treasury and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Offices, agreed with this approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 Window 1 of the fund opened for applications on 25 March and closed 10 April 2024. No outcomes were issued prior to the calling of the UK general election on 22 May. In line with election guidance the fund was paused awaiting the outcome of the election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of July, the Chancellor asked officials to prepare an assessment of the state of the UK’s spending inheritance from the previous government. After this announcement Round 4 of the Community Ownership Fund was put on pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the outcome of the Spending Review, at the direction of Ministers, officials at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government contacted all those applicants whose applications had met the minimum benchmark score to be considered for funding and undertook deliverability checks to determine whether their projects were still viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, further validation checks will take place as part of the COF onboarding process. This includes the satisfactory completion of an Initial Project Meeting (IPM), and a Grant Funding Agreement (GFA) that has been agreed and signed by both parties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach of the projects funded in this window will be prioritised for additional post-application support from our development support provider to help ensure their success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"considerations-of-the-equalities-impacts-of-ministerial-decisions\"\u003eConsiderations of the equalities impacts of ministerial decisions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMinisters received equalities analysis for the programme as part of the decision making process.

There will be no further application windows on the COF programme.\u003c/strong\u003e We have taken this difficult decision due to the challenging inheritance left by the previous government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhilst we are closing the Community Ownership Fund, this government remains committed to the communities’ sector and community empowerment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"internal-decision-making\"\u003eInternal decision-making\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"prioritisation-process-for-awarding-targeted-support\"\u003ePrioritisation process for awarding targeted support\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to prioritise in-depth support for applicants, our development support provider used a 4-step decision making process to prioritise applicants that passed the EOI stage. This included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e1. Using a suite of national metrics to determine the level of existing social infrastructure in a local place to prioritise the EOIs for further discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e2.

In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure was used.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe level of social infrastructure, which was provided by the Community Needs Index (CNI) for England, Scotland and Wales. CNI is not available for Northern Ireland.

This would only be agreed if evidence is provided to demonstrate the unforeseen impact inflation has had on their project costs. This process was approved by the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) for the Community Ownership Fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis support was available to Round 1 and Round 2 Window 1 projects only.

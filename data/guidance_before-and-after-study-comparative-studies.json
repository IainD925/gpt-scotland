Any changes in the outcomes are attributed to the product or intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis study design cannot rule out that something other than the product may have caused a change. Randomised controlled trials (\u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trials\"\u003eRCTs\u003c/abbr\u003e) are considered the most reliable way to show that your digital product has caused an outcome. However, it is not always possible to run an \u003cabbr title=\"randomised controlled trial\"\u003eRCT\u003c/abbr\u003e.

You will need to recruit enough participants to give you some confidence in your findings (\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/design-your-evaluation-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eread more about statistical power\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to assess and compare the outcomes before the introduction of the digital product and after the intervention period. You may want to assess the outcomes immediately at the end of the intervention period and later, to see if the effect continued after time has passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe length of the study will vary depending on the digital product and what you want to find out. For example, it might take a shorter time to show an increase in physical activity (behaviour outcome) than weight loss (the effect of doing physical activity).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMake the outcomes as specific as possible. For example, when assessing the effects of a digital toothbrush to encourage children to brush their teeth regularly, your outcome might be measured as total time (in seconds) the child brushed their teeth and the daily average time spent brushing the teeth over a certain time period (to assess regularity).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some contexts, you will need to take into account that some change over time is expected anyway. For example, you could carry out a before-and-after study on a mental health app in a group of participants showing high levels of depression symptoms. However, some people with depression symptoms recover over time without any intervention. If participants in the study show an improvement from the before measurement to the after measurement, you would not know whether that is because of the app or because they would have shown some improvement anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there are 2 groups and one group receives the intervention and the other doesn’t, this is called a controlled before-and-after study. A control group can give you more confidence in your results by telling you what the typical change over time is. Instead of a control group, you can use a historical control: historical data that follows up some participants. This tells you what the typical change over time is, but will miss any current events that might have an effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-effects-of-an-app-intervention-to-help-reduce-self-harming-in-young-people\"\u003eExample: effects of an app intervention to help reduce self-harming in young people\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Stallard and others (2019): \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/1/e32/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eA Smartphone App (BlueIce) for Young People Who Self-Harm: Open Phase 1 Pre-Post Trial\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe team developed a mobile app to support young people who experience self-harming, as a supplement to face-to-face therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey conducted a before-and-after study to assess the potential effects of the app. They recruited patients from specialist mental health services aged 12 to 17 years old who had a history of self-harming or were currently self-harming. They assessed the outcomes 3 times: at the start of the study, at 2 weeks (end of app familiarisation period), and again at 12 weeks (post-app use).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey gathered data on widely-accepted, self-reported measures – self-harming, depression, anxiety, behavioural issues – and also app-specific measures of safety and acceptability of the app. They also used existing data from clinical records to assess self-harming behaviour 4 weeks before each participant started the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey worked in collaboration with healthcare professionals who referred potential participants to the researchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParental consent was obtained for those under 16 years old and those above 16 years old could consent themselves. They got approval from a research ethics committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf 54 participants who were referred by healthcare professionals, 40 were eligible and 37 wanted to use the app after familiarising themselves with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn their analysis comparing the participants’ data at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of using the app, the team found that the app was highly acceptable and helpful to participants.

It works best when your requirements are well defined so the supplier can provide an accurate quote without incorporating extra costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe supplier must do all the work you specify in each particular statement of work within the time you agreed it would take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"time-and-materials\"\u003eTime and materials\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA time and materials approach means you own more of the risk. The supplier can send a pricing matrix showing how long they need to provide the work. If it takes longer to do the work defined in a statement of work, you pay the day rate and expenses for any extra days worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"capped-time-and-materials\"\u003eCapped time and materials\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA capped time and materials approach is the same as a time and materials approach but there’s a limit on how much you have to pay for the work. If you reach the limit before the work is finished, the supplier has to complete the work at their own cost. If the supplier finishes the work before they said they would, you only pay them for the time they took to do the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-pay-for-digital-specialist-services\"\u003eHow to pay for digital specialist services\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must pay specialist suppliers for the time they work using the day rate agreed in the contract.

For example, you may need to employ additional staff quickly. If you do this, the person must be supervised when working with children. You must be able to provide evidence that you have taken reasonable steps to obtain the information. There may be occasions when, despite your best efforts, you are not able to obtain some of the required information. We recognise that this might happen occasionally, but we do not expect it to happen regularly. It is not good recruitment practice to employ staff without all the required information. If you are unable to obtain all the relevant information, inspectors will want to know what additional action you took to satisfy yourself that the person was suitable and, if any relevant information was missing, what action you took to mitigate any risks you identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"written-references\"\u003eWritten references\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe regulations require you to obtain 2 written references, including one from the applicant’s last employer. You do not have to contact the person who wrote the reference to check that they did so, although this is good practice. You should always check out a reference if you have any doubt about its quality or reliability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may not be able to obtain a reference from a previous employer, for example because they are no longer operating, or have died. If this happens, you should ask for another reference from another previous employer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must try, as far as possible, to find out why a prospective staff member’s previous employment ended, if their previous jobs involved working with children or vulnerable adults. You should try to obtain this information from their most recent employer, and other employers where relevant. For example, this could be a conversation with the previous employer and you record the detail of this on the staff member’s file. You do not have to contact all of their previous employers unless you have a particular cause for concern. If you do have a concern, then we expect you to obtain as much information as you can to make sure that the person is suitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"recruitment-records\"\u003eRecruitment records\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do not keep full recruitment records at the home, inspectors will look at your list of staff or electronic records that summarise the vetting and recruitment checks. They will discuss with you how you have satisfied yourself that all staff working at the home are fit to do so and that your recruitment arrangements comply with the regulations. These records could be maintained in checklist or spreadsheet formats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn inspector may ask you to provide a small sample of full recruitment records, even if they are not held at the home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you use the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/dbs-update-service\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDBS update service\u003c/a\u003e to check the status of an individual’s DBS certificate, you should be able to demonstrate how you manage and record details of any check you carry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"agency-staff\"\u003eUsing agency staff\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to check the identity of any agency staff before you allow them to work at your home, to ensure that you have the correct person. However, you do not have to obtain all the other information yourself. For example, it is acceptable for you to see evidence of a clear DBS certificate and references, rather than apply for these yourself. You should be able to demonstrate the steps you took to satisfy yourself that the person was suitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need to use an agency member of staff at short notice, and you have not previously used this person, we expect you, as a minimum, to check their identity and obtain written confirmation from the agency that it has carried out the \u003ca href=\"#information\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003erelevant suitability checks\u003c/a\u003e. You should review the evidence that the person is suitable as soon as possible, for example the next working day. In these circumstances, the agency staff member must not be in sole charge of the home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInspectors may discuss with you the arrangements you have made with the agency or agencies you use to satisfy yourself that you can safely allow the staff they send to you to work at the home. Inspectors may ask to see the evidence you have used to make your decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"prospective-staff-spending-time-in-the-home\"\u003eProspective staff spending time in the home\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of your recruitment process, you may invite prospective employees to do a short ‘shadow shift’. This is so that they can experience what working in the home may be like and meet your children. We would expect you to manage this carefully and sensitively so that it is not overwhelming or unsettling for children and fits into the routine of the home. The prospective employee cannot be counted in staffing numbers during the ‘shadow shift.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospective employee must be supervised at all times during the shift because they are not yet employed by you, so the relevant regulations do not apply to them. You may introduce them to the children, but they should not have access to children’s detailed personal information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"carrying-out-interviews\"\u003eCarrying out interviews\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you carry out interviews for prospective employees at the setting, candidates must be supervised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

Ensuring such heritage assets remain used and valued is likely to require sympathetic changes to be made from time to time.

They can arise from conscious design or fortuitously from the way the heritage asset has evolved. More specifically, architectural interest is an interest in the art or science of the design, construction, craftsmanship and decoration of buildings and structures of all types. Artistic interest is an interest in other human creative skill, like sculpture.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehistoric interest: An interest in past lives and events (including pre-historic). Heritage assets can illustrate or be associated with them.

Thus, sustaining heritage assets in the long term often requires an incentive for their active conservation. Putting heritage assets to a viable use is likely to lead to the investment in their maintenance necessary for their long-term conservation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy their nature, some heritage assets have limited or even no economic end use. A scheduled monument in a rural area may preclude any use of the land other than as a pasture, whereas a listed building may potentially have a variety of alternative uses such as residential, commercial and leisure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a small number of cases a heritage asset may be capable of active use in theory but be so important and sensitive to change that alterations to accommodate a viable use would lead to an unacceptable loss of significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that any use is viable, not just for the owner, but also for the future conservation of the asset: a series of failed ventures could result in a number of unnecessary harmful changes being made to the asset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is only one viable use, that use is the optimum viable use. If there is a range of alternative economically viable uses, the optimum viable use is the one likely to cause the least harm to the significance of the asset, not just through necessary initial changes, but also as a result of subsequent wear and tear and likely future changes.  The optimum viable use may not necessarily be the most economically viable one. Nor need it be the original use. However, if from a conservation point of view there is no real difference between alternative economically viable uses, then the choice of use is a decision for the owner, subject of course to obtaining any necessary consents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHarmful development may sometimes be justified in the interests of realising the optimum viable use of an asset, notwithstanding the loss of significance caused, and provided the harm is minimised.

Where potential harm to designated heritage assets is identified, it needs to be categorised as either less than substantial harm or substantial harm (which includes total loss) in order to identify which policies in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/16-conserving-and-enhancing-the-historic-environment#para194\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Planning Policy Framework (paragraphs 194 to 196)\u003c/a\u003e apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin each category of harm (which category applies should be explicitly identified), the extent of the harm may vary and should be clearly articulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether a proposal causes substantial harm will be a judgment for the decision-maker, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the policy in the National Planning Policy Framework. In general terms, substantial harm is a high test, so it may not arise in many cases. For example, in determining whether works to a listed building constitute substantial harm, an important consideration would be whether the adverse impact seriously affects a key element of its special architectural or historic interest. It is the degree of harm to the asset’s significance rather than the scale of the development that is to be assessed. The harm may arise from works to the asset or from development within its setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the impact of total destruction is obvious, partial destruction is likely to have a considerable impact but, depending on the circumstances, it may still be less than substantial harm or conceivably not harmful at all, for example, when removing later additions to historic buildings where those additions are inappropriate and harm the buildings’ significance. Similarly, works that are moderate or minor in scale are likely to cause less than substantial harm or no harm at all. However, even minor works have the potential to cause substantial harm, depending on the nature of their impact on the asset and its setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe National Planning Policy Framework confirms that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). It also makes clear that any harm to a designated heritage asset requires clear and convincing justification and sets out certain assets in respect of which harm should be exceptional/wholly exceptional (see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/16-conserving-and-enhancing-the-historic-environment#para194\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNational Planning Policy Framework, paragraph 194\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 018 Reference ID: 18a-018-20190723\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 23 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-can-the-possibility-of-harm-to-conservation-areas-be-assessed\"\u003eHow can the possibility of harm to conservation areas be assessed?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/16-conserving-and-enhancing-the-historic-environment#para196\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eParagraph 201 of the National Planning Policy Framework\u003c/a\u003e is the starting point.  An unlisted building that makes a positive contribution to a conservation area is individually of lesser importance than a listed building.

Irrespective of how they are identified, it is important that the decisions to identify them as non-designated heritage assets are based on sound evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlan-making bodies should make clear and up to date information on non-designated heritage assets accessible to the public to provide greater clarity and certainty for developers and decision-makers.

They are of 3 types:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose that have yet to be formally assessed for designation.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose that have been assessed as being nationally important and therefore, capable of designation, but which the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has exercised his/her discretion not to designate.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethose that are incapable of being designated by virtue of being outside the scope of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 because of their physical nature.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason why many nationally important monuments are not scheduled is set out in the document Scheduled Monuments, published by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Information on location and significance of such assets is found in the same way as for all heritage assets. Judging whether sites fall into this category may be assisted by reference to the criteria for scheduling monuments. Further information on scheduled monuments can be found on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(2) Other non-designated heritage assets of archaeological interest. By comparison this is a much larger category of lesser heritage significance, although still subject to the conservation objective. On occasion the understanding of a site may change following assessment and evaluation prior to a planning decision and move it from this category to the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere an asset is thought to have archaeological interest, the potential knowledge which may be unlocked by investigation may be harmed even by minor disturbance, because the context in which archaeological evidence is found is crucial to furthering understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecision-making regarding such assets requires a proportionate response by local planning authorities. Where an initial assessment indicates that the site on which development is proposed includes or has potential to include heritage assets with archaeological interest, applicants should be required to submit an appropriate desk-based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation. However, it is estimated that following the initial assessment of archaeological interest only a small proportion – around 3% – of all planning applications justify a requirement for detailed assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 041 Reference ID: 18a-041-20190723\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 23 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"heritage-consent-processes\"\u003eHeritage consent processes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"is-listed-building-consent-the-same-as-planning-permission\"\u003eIs listed building consent the same as planning permission?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListed building consent and planning permission are 2 separate regimes.

The \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Department\"\u003eGLD\u003c/abbr\u003e provides advisory services to 11 Whitehall departments (including Home Office, Ministry of Justice, HM Treasury, Cabinet Office and the Departments for Education and Transport to name but a few) as well as most of the Government’s litigation and employment law services, along with a specialist Commercial Law Group and European law division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also in-house legal teams employed in, for example, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs (HMRC), as well as a range of smaller organisations and regulatory bodies such as Ofgem, the Law Commission and DVLA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e jobs are open to both solicitors and barristers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Treasury Solicitor is appointed by the Head of the Home Civil Service to be the Head of the Government Legal Service (\u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e). The Treasury Solicitor’s role is to supervise its well-being and to provide it with a degree of direction and overall coordination. The Treasury Solicitor is supported in this role by the \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e Secretariat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e does not include all government lawyers. Other organisations such as the Crown Prosecution Service, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Land Registry,  Parliamentary Counsel, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland legal teams, employ lawyers who are organisationally separate from the \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e. These legal teams are, however, kept in touch through participation in various \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e networks and groups.Most also have access to the \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e’ extranet site which enables them to keep in touch with developments and opportunities (training and jobs) and to share legal knowledge and practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"attorney-generals-office\"\u003eAttorney General’s Office\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attorney General and the Solicitor General (with the Advocate General for Scotland) are known as the Law Officers. They are Ministers of the Crown and sit in one or other House of Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Law Officers are the chief legal advisers to government. In that capacity they are consulted on the most sensitive or difficult legal issues facing the government, including issues of international and \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law. They deal with questions of law arising on government Bills and with issues of legal policy. They also have oversight of major international and domestic litigation involving the Government. The Attorney General has Ministerial responsibility for the Government Legal Department (\u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Department\"\u003eGLD\u003c/abbr\u003e) and oversight of the wider Government Legal Service (\u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attorney General has statutory responsibility for superintending the main prosecuting authorities in England and Wales – the Crown Prosecution Service (headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions) and the Serious Fraud Office. The Attorney also exercises non-statutory oversight of the Service Prosecuting Authority and prosecutors in other government departments. In addition the Attorney General has Ministerial responsibility for HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attorney General has, with the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Justice, a shared responsibility for the development of criminal justice policy. This role in particular reflects the Attorney’s responsibility for the prosecuting authorities and their important place in the criminal justice system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Law Officers have a number of common law and statutory responsibilities which they discharge independently of government as “guardians of the public interest”. These include referring unduly lenient sentences to the Court of Appeal; applying for orders under the Supreme Court Act 1981 to declare persons vexatious litigants; intervening in certain proceedings to protect the interests of charities; and bringing proceedings for contempt of court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attorney General also holds the separate office of Advocate General for Northern Ireland with a consultative relationship with the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland and a number of responsibilities in respect of Assembly Bills, devolution issues and other matters as set out in Schedule 7 to the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"work-of-the-legal-team\"\u003eWork of the Legal Team\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attorney General and Solicitor General are supported in all their functions by a small department, the Attorney General’s Office (AGO). AGO is led by its director general and comprises teams of civil and criminal lawyers (about 15 in all), as well as policy and administrative support staff. AGO lawyers provide legal advice and support to the Law Officers in connection with their legal, prosecutorial and public interest functions, including casework. In that capacity they handle some of the most difficult and sensitive legal issues affecting the government. The lawyers also work closely with policy officials to support the Law Officers in their criminal justice and other work. They maintain close liaison with lawyers elsewhere in the \u003cabbr title=\"Government Legal Service\"\u003eGLS\u003c/abbr\u003e and in the prosecuting authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"recruitment\"\u003eRecruitment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost AGO staff are on loan for varying periods of time from other government departments, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

In additional, the Legal Services team also plays a vital role in protecting businesses and increasing consumer confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Criminal Enforcement teams investigate and prosecute criminal breaches of the Insolvency and Companies regimes and other departmental legislation, ranging from bankruptcy offences and rogue traders to serious and complex fraudulent trading. Across the country, the increased publicity given to successful prosecutions, which secure significant sentences of imprisonment, disqualification and the confiscation of the proceeds of crime, has raised the BIS profile as a prosecuting authority and continues to act as a deterrent to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe work is intellectually demanding and involves a broad range of government legal skills:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edrafting statutory instruments and other legal documents\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eadvising on the interpretation of existing legislation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einstructing Parliamentary Counsel on new primary legislation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eadvising on the implementation of \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etaking part in international negotiations especially on \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e matters\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003einvestigating and prosecuting companies and individuals.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLawyers in the advisory teams in the Legal Services Group advise BIS Ministers and officials on English, \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e and international law that impacts on the department’s work.

It was created to overcome the perceived conflict faced by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in balancing the interests of the food industry on the one hand and consumers on the other. The handling of the BSE crisis was one of the reasons behind the setting up of the Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe independence of the Agency is enhanced by its power to publish information, including the advice it gives to Ministers.

We strive to provide a transport system that is an engine for economic growth, but one that is also greener and safer and improves quality of life in our communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOvercrowding on railways and congestion on the roads are familiar to all of us. Air travel has trebled in the past 20 years. With an ageing population, the need for accessible transport increases. Access by public transport to jobs in rural areas an important aspect of dealing with social exclusion. Security is vital in our domestic and international transport services. Our lawyers play a vital role in resolving these issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"work-of-the-legal-team-12\"\u003eWork of the Legal Team\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe advise on a wide range of railway, road, aviation and marine issues, covering domestic, \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e and International law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"law-making\"\u003eLaw-making\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lawyers help to create new legislation. We are closely involved in briefing Ministers and attend Parliament during all stages of a Bill’s passage – for example DfT’s bill to modernise the system of economic regulation for large UK airports. If a bill is taken forward to build a new high speed railway – our lawyers will be part of the front line team to get the Bill in to and through the Houses of Parliament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also draft secondary legislation ourselves, including implementing European Directives. We have for example drafted domestic Regulations implementing an \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e Directive relating to the railway system that allows for the safe and uninterrupted movement of trains in the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e; and Regulations which will help ensure that the UK meets its 2020 \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e renewable energy targets in the transport sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"advisory-work\"\u003eAdvisory work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are closely involved in developing and implementing policy, and advise on particular issues or cases as they arise. \nInternational work is an important part of what we do. European law, for example, influences how we operate. Often, our lawyers travel to Brussels for negotiations, which might relate to a new \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e Directive, a state aid case or a complaint to the Commission that the UK is not complying with \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e law. Knowledge and application of the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights are also a feature of our advisory role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur lawyers also have opportunities to travel as a result of the UK’s participation in other international bodies, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComplex public law issues can arise, requiring an understanding of how government operates, how it exercises its powers, and how it should meet its responsibilities. We apply our skills to matters as varied as streetworks and traffic management, maritime security and the carriage of dangerous goods. Advice may need to be produced under pressure and under intense public scrutiny. The terrorist attacks in the US in September 2001 generated a flurry of activity in aviation security and it was vital that we were able to advise quickly on proposed security measures. More recently our lawyers have been working to develop strategies to protect UK ships from piracy at sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe devolution implications of the department’s policies are very much part of the legal environment in which we work. Our advice is sought on the scope of new legislation with respect to the devolved administrations and on the competence of Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales. Can Westminster legislate for children to wear seatbelts in school buses in Wales and Scotland for example?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe frequently offer guidance on compliance with the Data Protection Act. Since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act, we also advise on the need for open Government. Lawyers advising on employment issues have an unusual opportunity to work at the cutting edge of law and policy, helping to implement the Government’s commitment to best practice as an employer. \nLawyers with an interest in commercial matters, for example the way in which transport projects are financed, will find much to stimulate them. For example, multi-billion pound procurement projects for the railways mean that our lawyers can develop expertise in complex financing, corporate law and regulatory issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"disputes\"\u003eDisputes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe department’s work can give rise to disputes.

Advisory and drafting lawyers are also responsible for the drafting of statutory instruments, many of which originate from European measures, and are involved at all stages from negotiation of the text of Directives to consultation on proposed Regulations.

There are 135 staff at OSPT, including 40 lay case managers and 22 lawyers, who provide additional advice to the lay case managers, act as case managers themselves and conduct litigation on behalf of the Official Solicitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the lawyers advises the Official Solicitor and the Public Trustee in respect of their trust estates and deputyship work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Official Solicitor currently has 2,350 cases in which he is acting as litigation friend. They include civil and family cases of all types and cases in the Court of Protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Official Solicitor holds trust and estate assets of some £45m; has 32 deputyships; and acts in 10,273 child trust funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Public Trustee is a corporation sole.  He acts as executor or administrator of estates and as the appointed trustee of settlements. In recent years, he has accepted appointment only as a last resort. Under section 9 Administration of Estates Act 1925 where a person dies intestate his estate vests in the Public Trustee until a grant is taken out; and where a person dies leaving a will but, at the time of his death or before a grant of probate is obtained, there ceases to be a person with power to obtain probate of the will, his estate vests in the Public Trustee until a grant of representation is obtained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder section 18 Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 where a person has died and a grant of representation has not yet been filed, service of notices affecting property will be sufficiently served if addressed to the personal representatives of the deceased and left or sent by post to his last known address and a copy of it is served on the Public Trustee. Under Part V of the First Schedule to the Law of Property Act 1925 an open space of property held prior to 1 January 1926 upon a tenancy in common was vested in the Public Trustee upon statutory trusts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Public Trustee holds trust and estates assets of some £7m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"further-information-15\"\u003eFurther Information\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, please visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/official-solicitor-and-public-trustee\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eOfficial Solicitor and Public Trustee website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"office-of-rail-regulation\"\u003eOffice of Rail Regulation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) is the independent safety and economic regulator for Britain’s railways. Our main roles in the context of economic regulation are to regulate Network Rail’s stewardship of the national rail network, to licence operators of railway assets and to approve track and station access agreements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also have concurrent jurisdiction with the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate potential breaches of the Competition Act 1998 in relation to the railways. In safety regulation, our principal function is to secure the safe operation of the railway system and to protect both those working on the system and members of the public from health and safety risks arising from the railways. We work in a complex, stimulating, and often high-profile environment which is vital to the nation’s infrastructure and involves stakeholders from across the rail industry and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ORR legal services team is a small, friendly and supportive team of around ten lawyers from a mixture of Civil Service and private practice backgrounds. The team provides legal advice in respect of all ORR’s functions as a combined economic and safety regulator. It includes lawyers who provide advice in respect of ORR’s wide ranging economic functions. It also includes a team which advises on rail safety enforcement carries out prosecutions for health and safety offences on the railways and has involvement in inquests arising from deaths on the railways. Members of the team work closely with policy and other colleagues in ORR’s various directorates and with industry stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"further-information-16\"\u003eFurther Information\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, please visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-rail-regulation\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eORR website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"serious-fraud-office\"\u003eSerious Fraud Office\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigates and prosecutes serious or complex fraud, bribery and corruption. The department is headed by a Director who exercises powers under the superintendence of the Attorney General and is an integral part of the criminal justice system. The SFO aims to contribute to reducing economic crime and its cost to society, to delivering justice and to maintaining confidence in the UK’s business and financial institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department conducts both the investigation and the prosecution of cases involving serious or complex fraud, bribery and corruption and is dedicated to working effectively and efficiently, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies both in the UK and abroad. The SFO deals with around 40 cases at any given time. These may involve bribery and corruption or fraud (including investment, banking or corporate frauds, frauds targeting Government or \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e bodies and those involving the manipulation of financial markets).

Each case is allocated to a team of lawyers, financial investigators, IT and other support staff.  Each team is led by a case controller (many of whom are experienced lawyers) who is responsible for all aspects of the investigation and any ensuing prosecution. Counsel and other experts may be instructed and work closely with the team throughout. SFO work is difficult and challenging - it attracts considerable press and public interest - but the staff are highly motivated and are drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as roles for lawyers as case controllers, case teams normally include other lawyers, who can be involved in interviewing witnesses and suspects (often under the SFO’s statutory powers), taking statements and analysing evidence. They may need to coordinate with other agencies, advise on difficult legal or practical issues, or obtain foreign or expert evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLawyers also work in the SFO’s Proceeds of Crime (POC) Division, a specialist team that conducts proceedings with the aim of recovering the proceeds of crime in accordance with the SFO’s strategic objectives. Working together with financial investigators, lawyers in the POC Division are involved in asset recovery work conducting complex confiscation and asset recovery cases, including restraint proceedings, confiscation hearings, enforcement activity, and third party litigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLawyers also work in the Strategic Relations Division on a variety of matters, such as cross Whitehall policy development, advising the SFO’s International Team which deals with mutual legal assistance matters, and providing guidance on topics such as Freedom of Information and Data Protection law, new legislation and SFO procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"further-information-17\"\u003eFurther Information\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor further information, please visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/serious-fraud-office\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSFO website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"water-services-regulation-authority\"\u003eWater Services Regulation Authority \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) is the economic regulator of the water and sewerage industry in England and Wales.

Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by eating and drinking contaminated food or water. Cases of cholera may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, including acute, profuse watery diarrhoea (‘rice water stools’) and vomiting, leading to dehydration. Some infections may progress to severe disease, and in extreme cases may result in death if untreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCholera occurs mainly in Asia, Africa and the Americas, and there have been large outbreaks reported in recent years in Africa and Asia. Cholera does not occur in the UK but is sometimes reported in returning overseas travellers. Activities that may increase the risk of infection include drinking untreated water or eating poorly cooked food (particularly seafood) in areas where outbreaks are occurring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA vaccine is available but is only recommended for some travellers.

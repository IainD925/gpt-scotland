Many feared being taken as political prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDue to their immense contribution to the war efforts, the Poles were seen in Whitehall and the wider community as deserving of special support and assistance.

It was known affectionately as the Winston Churchill promise and made the then Assistance Board responsible for meeting the needs of qualifying Poles and their dependants. A total of 45 resettlement camps were set up across Great Britain, including Ilford Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday Ilford Park is now the last remaining home run by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), who took on this responsibility from the Assistance Board, under the 1947 act. The home first opened in 1948 at Stover Camp, the site of a hospital built for expected D-Day casualties amongst American troops. Its original purpose was to resettle members of the Polish forces into a new life in the UK but over the years it evolved into a residential care and nursing home for elderly Polish veterans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe home has retained a strong sense of community and commitment to Polish values and traditions and is affectionately known by its residents, the local community in Devon and Polish organisations as “Little Poland”. Today, its residents are those who were unable to make the transition from a resettlement camp into the outside community and those who were initially able to integrate, but in later years found themselves unable to cope.\nDue to the disrepair of the original home, in 1987 ministers committed to build a new home on the original site using 9 acres of the 41 acre site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ilford-park-today\"\u003eIlford Park today\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn November 1991, Lord Henley laid the foundation stone for the new home and on 16 December 1992 he opened the home at a ceremony attended by the Polish Consul General, representatives of Polish organisations and the then Department of Social Security Permanent Secretary. The new premises provide a home for 98 residents in the 81 bed residential care wing, the 14 bed nursing home and 3 independent bungalows. Ilford Park has a national catchment area, primarily from where the original camps used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5e4abb3f40f0b677bd7abf27/IPPH3_resized.jpg\" alt=\"View of Ilford Park Polish Home\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eView of Ilford Park Polish Home.

It’s designed to help employers understand their legal obligations to workers, including those who were previously on furlough as part of the government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance should not be treated as legal advice.

The exception is those who are genuinely self-employed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of calculating holiday entitlement, the statutory 5.6 weeks entitlement is split into 4 weeks derived from EU law, and an additional 1.6 weeks from UK law. This guidance focuses on the legal minimum entitlement of 5.6 weeks. Many workers have contracts that entitle them to additional paid holiday beyond this, known as contractual holiday entitlement. Workers and employers can agree to alter the terms of the worker’s contract, providing it does not go below the statutory minimum of 5.6 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA worker has the same holiday entitlement, regardless of whether they are on sick leave, maternity leave, parental leave and adoption leave, and other types of statutory leave. A worker may request holiday at the same time they are on sick leave but cannot be required to take it while off sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"workers-who-were-furloughed\"\u003eWorkers who were furloughed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorkers who were on furlough continued to accrue statutory holiday entitlements during that time, and any additional holiday provided for under their employment contract. Use the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003egovernment holiday entitlement calculator\u003c/a\u003e to calculate a worker’s statutory holiday entitlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"taking-holiday\"\u003eTaking holiday\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmployers can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erequire workers to take holiday\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecancel a worker’s holiday, if they give enough notice to the worker\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe required notice periods are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edouble the length of the holiday if the employer wishes to require a worker to take holiday on particular days\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe length of the planned holiday if the employer wishes to cancel a worker’s holiday or require the worker not to take holiday on particular dates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmployers can ask workers to take or cancel holiday with less notice but need the workers’ agreement to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese notice periods are in advance of the first day of the holiday, and the notice must be given before the notice period starts.  For example, if an employer wanted to prevent a worker taking a week’s holiday, they would have to give notice earlier than 1 week before the first day of the holiday. For the purposes of calculating the notice period, any uninterrupted period of holiday counts as a single period. These rules on notice periods can be altered by a binding written agreement between the employer and the worker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"holiday-pay\"\u003eHoliday pay\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of pay that a worker receives for the holiday they take depends on the number of hours they work and how they are paid for those hours. The principle is that pay received by a worker while they are on holiday should reflect what they would have earned if they had been at work and working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHoliday pay, whether a worker was on furlough or not, should be calculated in line with current legislation - see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estandard guidance\u003c/a\u003e, based on a worker’s usual earnings. The underlying principle is that a worker should not be financially worse off through taking holiday. Where a worker has regular hours and pay, their holiday pay would be calculated based on these hours. If they have variable hours or pay, their holiday pay is calculated as an average of the previous 52-weeks of remuneration excluding weeks in which there was no remuneration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"workers-who-were-furloughed-1\"\u003eWorkers who were furloughed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn employer should not automatically pay a worker on holiday the rate of pay that they were receiving while on furlough, unless the employer had agreed to not reduce the worker’s pay while on furlough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a worker on furlough took annual leave, an employer must have calculated and paid the correct holiday pay in accordance with current legislation - see the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estandard guidance\u003c/a\u003e. Where this calculated rate was above the pay the worker received while on furlough, the employer should have paid the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorkers who were furloughed but are now working should continue to receive the correct holiday pay in accordance with the current legislation – as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estandard guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"carrying-annual-leave-into-future-leave-years\"\u003eCarrying annual leave into future leave years\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 5.6 weeks of statutory holiday is split into 4 weeks and 1.6 weeks, and there are some differences in the rules that apply:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe 1.6 weeks can be carried forward into the following leave year if a written agreement exists between the worker and the employer\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003egenerally, the 4 weeks cannot be carried into future leave years, so employers must facilitate these weeks being taken within the relevant leave year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, under certain circumstances employers must allow the 4 weeks to be carried into future leave years. Where a worker cannot take annual leave due to them being on maternity leave or sick, employers must still allow workers to carry their annual leave forwards. These rights remain unaffected by a worker being furloughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is set out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/calculate-leave-entitlement\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCalculate leave entitlement\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"carrying-leave-forwards-how-new-legislation-has-changed-the-rules\"\u003eCarrying leave forwards: how new legislation has changed the rules\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has passed new emergency legislation to ensure businesses have the flexibility they need to respond to the pandemic and to protect workers from losing their statutory holiday entitlement (The Working Time (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, laid before Parliament on 27 March 2020). These regulations enable workers to carry holiday forward where the impact of COVID-19 means that it has not been reasonably practicable to take it in the leave year to which it relates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere it has not been reasonably practicable for the worker to take some or all of the 4 weeks holiday due to the effects of COVID-19, the untaken amount may be carried forward into the following 2 leave years. When calculating how much holiday a worker can carry forwards, employers must give workers the opportunity to take any leave that they cannot carry forward before the end of the leave year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"what-is-reasonably-practicable\"\u003eWhat is reasonably practicable?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen considering whether it was not reasonably practicable for a worker to take leave as a result of the pandemic, so that they may carry untaken holiday into future leave years, an employer should consider various factors, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhether the business has faced a significant increase in demand due to COVID-19 that would reasonably require the worker to continue to be at work and cannot be met through alternative practical measures\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe extent to which the business’ workforce is disrupted by the pandemic and the practical options available to the business to provide temporary cover of essential activities\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe health of the worker and how soon they need to take a period of rest and relaxation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe length of time remaining in the worker’s leave year, to enable the worker to take holiday at a later date within the leave year\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe extent to which the worker taking leave would impact on wider society’s response to, and recovery from, the pandemic\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe ability of the remainder of the available workforce to provide cover for the worker going on leave\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEmployers should do everything reasonably practicable to ensure that the worker is able to take as much of their leave as possible in the year to which it relates, and where leave is carried forward, it’s best practice to give workers the opportunity to take holiday at the earliest practicable opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"workers-who-were-furloughed-2\"\u003eWorkers who were furloughed\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorkers who were furloughed are unlikely to have needed to carry forward statutory annual leave, as it would have been easier for them to take it during the furlough period (in most cases at least). However, they must have been paid the correct holiday pay which was likely to be higher than the rate of pay that was covered by government grants, with the employer making up the difference - see \u003ca href=\"#holiday-pay\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eHoliday pay\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf, due to the impact of COVID-19 on operations, the employer was unable to fund the difference, this may have meant it was not reasonably practicable for the worker to take their leave, enabling the worker to carry most or all of their annual leave forwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this situation, the worker must still be given the opportunity to take their annual leave after the furlough scheme ended, at the correct holiday pay, before the carried annual leave is lost at the end of the next 2 leave years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis 2-year time limit applies to all annual leave carried forward under the COVID-19 regulations, regardless of the reason the leave needed to be carried forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"examples-of-what-may-be-reasonably-practicable\"\u003eExamples of what may be reasonably practicable\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"example\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample 1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA worker had 2 weeks of holiday left under regulation 13, and their leave year expired in 2 months. Owing to the pandemic, a significant proportion of the employer’s workforce was unable to work during those 2 months. The employer assessed what steps it could reasonably take to manage the 2-month period, and this assessment showed that it was not reasonably practicable for the worker to take both weeks of holiday in what was left of the worker’s leave year. They agreed that the worker would take one week in the remaining part of the leave year, and that the other week would be carried forwards to be taken as early as possible in the following leave year, when the situation allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA worker had just started a new leave year, and as such had their full leave entitlement to take over the next 12 months. Their employer experienced a significant short-term increase in demand that was anticipated to last for 3 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe employer agreed with the worker that while it would not be practicable to take holiday in the 3 months where demand had increased, it would be possible for the worker to utilise their full entitlement in the rest of the leave year, so there iwas no need to carry holiday forwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"handling-leave-that-has-been-carried-forward\"\u003eHandling leave that has been carried forward\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a worker carries leave forwards due to the pandemic, they will continue to accrue holiday in the next leave year.

In practice, this means that workers should be allowed to take the holiday to which they are entitled in the new leave year before they take the ‘carried’ holiday, as the ‘carried holiday’ entitlement lasts for 2 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, ‘carried holiday’ is subject to further protections – to be able to refuse to allow a worker to take ‘carried holiday’ on particular dates, the employer must have good reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe employer may request that the worker takes ‘carried holiday’ instead of their regular entitlement. If they do so, the employer must still ensure that the worker receives their full regular entitlement in the leave year to which it relates, in addition to any carried holiday taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere carried leave is carried into a further leave year, the employer must facilitate the worker taking their leave in that later year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"giving-notice-to-workers\"\u003eGiving notice to workers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no statutory requirement to give workers notice that they will be able to carry holiday forward if they do not take it.

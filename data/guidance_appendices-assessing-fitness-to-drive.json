A driver who is suffering from a relevant disability must not be licensed, but there are some prescribed disabilities where licensing is permitted provided certain conditions are met.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eProspective disabilities are any medical conditions that, because of their progressive or intermittent nature, may develop into relevant disabilities in time. Examples are Parkinson’s disease and early dementia. A driver with a prospective disability may be granted a driving licence for up to 5 years, after which renewal requires further medical review.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSections 92 and 94 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 also cover drivers with physical disabilities who require adaptations to their vehicles to ensure safe control. These adaptations must be coded and shown on the licence.

An isolated seizure is prescribed for the purposes of section 92(4)(b) of the Traffic Act 1988 in relation to an applicant for a Group 1 licence, who:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(i) in a case where there is an underlying causative factor that may increase future risk, has had such a seizure more than one year immediately before the date when the licence is granted\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eand\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(ii) in any other case, has had such a seizure more than 6 months immediately before the date when the licence is granted\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) has had no other unprovoked seizure since that

that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) so far as is predictable, the applicant complies with the directions regarding treatment for epilepsy or isolated seizure, including directions as to regular medical check-ups made as part of that treatment, which may from time to time be given by a registered medical practitioner or one of the clinical team working under the supervision of that registered medical practitioner\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) if required to do so by the Secretary of State, the applicant has provided a signed declaration agreeing to observe the condition in

licence, where two or more epileptic seizures have occurred, or that person has been prescribed medication to treat epilepsy, during the previous ten year period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(8A) Epilepsy is prescribed for the purposes of section 92(4)(b) of the Traffic Act 1988 in relation to an applicant for a group 2 licence who:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) in the case of a person whose last epileptic seizure was an isolated seizure satisfies the conditions in paragraph (8C) and (8D)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eor\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) in any other case, satisfies the conditions set out in paragraph (8D) and who, for a period of at least 10 years immediately preceding the date when the licence is granted has:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(i) been free from any epileptic seizure\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eand\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(ii) has not been prescribed any medication to treat epilepsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(8B) An isolated seizure is prescribed for the purposes of section 92(2) of the Traffic Act 1988 as a relevant disability, in relation to an applicant for, or a holder of, a Group 2 licence, where during the previous 5 year period, such a seizure has occurred, or that person has been prescribed medication to treat epilepsy or a seizure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(8C) An isolated seizure is prescribed for the purposes of section 92(4)(b) of the Traffic Act 1988 in relation to an applicant for a Group 2 licence who satisfies the conditions set out in paragraph (8D) and who, for a period of at least 5 years immediately preceding the date when the licence is granted:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) has been free from any unprovoked seizure\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eand\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) has not been prescribed medication to treat epilepsy or a seizure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(8D) The conditions are that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(a) if required by the Secretary of State, there has been an appropriate medical assessment by a neurologist\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eand\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(b) the Secretary of State is satisfied that the driving of a vehicle by the applicant, in accordance with the licence, is not likely to be a source of danger to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"withdrawal-of-epilepsy-medication\"\u003eWithdrawal of epilepsy medication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance relates only to epilepsy treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring epilepsy medication being withdrawn or changed on the advice of a healthcare professional, the risk of further epileptic seizures should be considered relating to the recommendations from DVLA, and regarding insurance implications, the driver should be advised to inform their insurance company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an epileptic seizure does occur, the patient will need to meet the medical standards before resuming driving and will need to be counselled accordingly. If the change is under medical supervision a reduced period of 6 months may apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is clearly recognised that withdrawal of epilepsy medication is associated with a risk of seizure recurrence. A number of studies have shown this, including a randomised study of withdrawal in patients in remission conducted by the Medical Research Council’s study group on epilepsy drug withdrawal. This study showed a 40% increased risk of seizure associated with the first year of withdrawal compared with continued treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State for Transport’s Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Driving and Disorders of the Nervous System states that patients should be warned of the risk they run, both of losing their driving licence and of having a seizure that could result in a road traffic accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Advisory Panel states that drivers should usually be advised not to drive from the start of the withdrawal period and for 6 months after treatment cessation – it considers that a person remains as much at risk of seizure during the withdrawal as during the following 6 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis advice may not be appropriate in every case, however. One specific example is withdrawal of anticonvulsant medication when there is a well-established history of seizures only while asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn such cases, any restriction on driving is best determined by the healthcare professional concerned, after considering the history. It is the patient’s legal duty to comply with medical advice on driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to remember that the driver licensing rules remain relevant in cases of medication being omitted as opposed to withdrawn, such as on admission to hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor changes of medication, for example due to side effect profiles, the following general advice is applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhen changing from one medication to another and both would be reasonably expected to be equally efficacious, then no period of time off driving is recommended.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhen the new medication is felt to be less efficacious than the previous medication, the 6 months off driving period is recommended. This time period would start from the end of the change over period.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny restriction on driving is best determined by the healthcare professional concerned in light of the specific circumstances of the case and the patient’s history. Clinicians may want to consider whether restricting driving is appropriate where medication is being changed during or after pregnancy due to the effects of the pregnancy on drug metabolism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"provoked-seizures\"\u003eProvoked seizures\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be considered a provoked seizure, the seizure must be attributable solely to a recognisable provoking cause and that causative factor must be reliably avoidable.   It should be clear that the seizure has been provoked by a stimulus which is unlikely to be repeated.

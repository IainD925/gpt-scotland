The review is an audit of what the EU does and how it affects the UK. This document is a guide to key elements of EU law, for reference in relation to the review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"short-guide\"\u003eShort guide\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe European Union, which succeeded the European Community, was established by the EU Treaties – see further below. The parties to the treaties are the Member States of the EU – currently there are 28 Member States including the UK. Under the treaties the Member States confer competences on the EU – such as the power to adopt legislation. The EU can only act within the limits of its competences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EU has a number of institutions, such as the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament. Acting together or separately, these institutions pass laws (such as regulations, directives or decisions), which may take effect automatically in the UK’s legal systems or require the UK to pass national legislation to give effect to the EU laws. The UK may also be affected by the treaties themselves, which may restrict what the UK can do, for example, restricting the UK’s power to limit  imports from other Member States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Court of Justice of the European Union interprets the treaties and the laws which the EU passes and decides if Member States have abided by them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two key EU treaties, which have been amended several times. They are the Treaty on the European Union (‘TEU’, originally the Maastricht Treaty), and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’, originally called the Treaty of Rome). The treaties are effective in the UK by virtue of the European Communities Act 1972, as amended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"history\"\u003eHistory\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe European Economic Community was established in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome, and became the European Community (EC) in 1967. The Treaty of Rome gave the Community a number of tasks including establishing a common market and progressively approximating the economic policies of the Member States. The United Kingdom joined the Community in 1973, and confirmed that decision in a UK-wide referendum in 1975.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1986, the Single European Act  made further provision for the establishment of the common market, now referred to as the ‘internal market’, and defined as an area without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured.  The Single Market Act also added a number of new policy areas to the Community’s competence, including, for example, a specific environmental competence. . The Maastricht Treaty followed in 1993. This treaty established the European Union, which had a three pillar structure, with the European Community being the first pillar, the  common foreign and security policy the second pillar  and justice and home affairs (covering immigration and asylum, civil judicial cooperation and police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters) the third pillar. Further changes were made by the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) and the Treaty of Nice (2000), including to the competences of the Union.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EU entered a period of expansion, reaching 28 Member States by 2013. This prompted calls for a new Treaty. After long discussion, the Lisbon treaty was signed in 2007. This treaty renamed and amended the original treaties, collapsed the three pillar system into a single European Union, and incorporated the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the EU Treaties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"glossary\"\u003eGlossary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eTerm\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth scope=\"col\"\u003eDefinition\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAcquis\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAlso known as the ‘acquis communautaire’: the combined law of the EU, as expressed through the Treaties, Regulations, Directives, Decisions, Delegated Acts, Implementing Acts, and the case law of the Court of Justice.

Competence in this context is about everything deriving from EU law that affects what happens in the UK.  That means examining all the areas where the Treaties give the EU competence to act, including the provisions in the Treaties giving the EU institutions the power to legislate, to adopt non-legislative acts, or to take any other sort of action. But it also means examining areas where the Treaties apply directly to the Member States without needing any further action by the EU institutions. The EU’s competences are set out in the EU Treaties, which provide the basis for any actions the EU institutions take.  The EU can only act within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the Treaties, and where the Treaties do not confer competences on the EU they remain with the Member States. [Article 5(2) TEU]\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eExclusive Competence\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAreas in which only the EU can adopt legal acts.

To the extent that the EU exercises its shared competence, the Member States are not free to exercise their competence, but may do so again once the EU ceases to exercise the competence (for example, by repealing a legislative act without replacing it). [Articles 2(2) and 4 TFEU]\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eParallel Competence\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAreas where the EU has competence to carry out activities and conduct a common policy, but the Member States can exercise competence as well. The EU’s and Member States’ policy in these areas “should complement and reinforce each other”. Parallel competence is basically the same as supporting competence.

Action by the EU does not prevent the Member States from taking action of their own and the Treaties explicitly prohibit harmonisation of laws.

It establishes ethical principles and rights for EU citizens and residents that relate to dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship and justice. While the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is limited to protecting civil and political rights, the Charter goes further to cover workers’ social rights, data protection, bioethics and the right to good administration. The Charter does not extend the competences of the Union beyond those already granted in the Treaties and only applies to Member States when they are implementing EU law.  [Article 6 TEU]\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eCouncil of Europe\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eA different organisation from the EU, with 47 member states (as opposed to the EU’s 27). Founded in 1949, the Council of Europe aims to achieve greater unity between its members through discussion and action in relation to a broad range of areas of common concern. The best known agreement of the Council of Europe is the European Convention on Human Rights.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eCouncil of Ministers\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe Council of the European Union (“Council of Ministers” or “Council”), along with the European Council, is the Union’s main policy-making body. It also, jointly with the European Parliament, exercises legislative and budgetary functions.  Its meetings are attended by Member State ministers, and it is thus the institution which, along with the European Council, represents the Member States. The Council meets in different configurations, bringing together different Member State ministers depending upon the issue at hand. For instance, Council meetings on Education are attended by the Secretary of State for Education. [Article 16 TEU and Articles 237 to 243 TFEU]\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eCourt of Justice of the European Union\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe CJEU has jurisdiction to rule on the interpretation and application of the Treaties. In particular, the Court has jurisdiction to rule on challenges to the validity of EU acts, in infraction proceedings brought by the Commission against Member States and on references from national courts concerning the interpretation of EU acts. The Court is made up of three sub-courts: the General Court, the Civil Service Tribunal (which hears cases about EU staff members) and the Court of Justice (which is sometimes called the ECJ).

A legislative act, such as a Directive or a Regulation, can delegate power to the Commission to adopt delegated acts to supplement or amend  non-essential elements of the legislative act.

Directives must be transposed into national law using domestic legislation, in contrast to Regulations, which are enforceable as law in their own right. [Article 288 TFEU]\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eEnhanced Cooperation\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eEnhanced cooperation is where a group of Member States act under the treaties in an area where there is not sufficient support to adopt legislation binding on all Member States. The Council must authorise the enhanced cooperation and there must be at least 9 participating Member States. Acts adopted under the enhanced cooperation arrangements only bind the participating Member States and must comply with a number of safeguards, including not undermining the internal market. . Enhanced cooperation cannot extend the powers of the EU, or apply to areas that fall within the EU’s exclusive competence. [Article 20 TEU and Articles 326 to 334 TFEU]\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eEuropean Commission\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe Commission is the main executive body of the EU. It has general executive and management functions. In most cases it has the sole right to propose EU legislation. In many areas it negotiates international agreements on behalf of the EU and represents the EU in international organisations. And the Commission also oversees and enforces the application of Union law, in particular by initiating infraction proceedings where it considers that a Member State has not complied with its EU obligations.

Through interactive storytelling and activities, to educate about her contributions and the values she represents. “Nurse Dessie” fosters early childhood learning and social skill development, promoting compassion, resilience, and inclusivity. The project aligns with the Ethos of the Associations founder Desline Stewart MBE who is of Jamaican descent and was a part of the Windrush group who arrived in the UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1973. Desline Stewart MBE was first elected as a Luton councillor of the Leagrave ward in 1983. She became the town’s first Black female Mayor in 1985 and, since then, has been involved with many charitable organisations. Because of her generosity, Desline Stewart MBE also received Her Majesty’s MBE Award for her community work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe preliminary work for Mary Seacole Housing Association began in the 1980s, in Councillor Desline Stewart’s kitchen, in response to the direct pleas of young people who were running away from home. Mary Seacole was chosen as the name for the trust by Councillor Stewart because she strongly advocated Seacole’s humanitarian work and altruism. We want to celebrate this altruism, whether Desline’s and Mary’s or via narrative of the Windrush generation. We appreciate that celebrating diversity is a collective effort that raises cultural awareness and appreciation for the Windrush generation’s heritage. We are excited to collaborate with local organisations such as schools, hospitals, and community events, as your participation is crucial in creating shared experiences. Together, we can extend the impact of this initiative in the community and promote the rich legacy of the Windrush generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e8. \u003cstrong\u003eGolden Stars Kids Club \u0026amp; Training CIC\u003c/strong\u003e West Midlands £14,450.00\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Windrush 76 anniversary project for children and young people is a meaningful and educational initiative that aims to celebrate the contributions of the Windrush generation.

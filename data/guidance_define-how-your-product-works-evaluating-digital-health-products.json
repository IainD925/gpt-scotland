This can help you to identify gaps in the evidence for how your product works and to improve the design of the product. For example, how will your app designed to stop people smoking actually increase the proportion of people giving up smoking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou might know this mapping process by names such as logic model, theory of change or benefit mapping. If you have already mapped how your product works, it is still useful to revisit this when planning your evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-create-a-product-model\"\u003eWhy create a product model\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA product model represents how a product is expected to work. This can be shown as a diagram to help you visualise the different processes and how they fit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a high-level view of the programme’s components and how you intend them to produce certain health outcomes. It doesn’t need to model the programme in step-by-step detail. The focus is on understanding how the digital product should work for the purposes of evaluating it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"create-your-model-in-a-workshop\"\u003eCreate your model in a workshop\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProduct models are usually designed by a team rather than individuals. You can do this in a workshop. \nThe aim is to produce a living document that can be updated as your digital health product changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCreating your model in a workshop helps your team understand:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat the project aims are\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehow you will achieve your project aims\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat evidence you need to prove you have achieved your aims\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewhat you need to find out from your evaluation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a product model may also be useful beyond planning an evaluation, for example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto help a development team agree on plans\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eto help describe the product to future users or commissioners\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5de8c5eee5274a06e448c08e/model-workshop.JPG\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-run-a-product-model-workshop\"\u003eWhen to run a product model workshop\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recommend developing your model as soon as you have an idea of the outcomes your product is aiming to achieve. This will help you evaluate your design process, as well as the product itself. However, you can also develop or revisit your model when planning your evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA product model workshop can be carried out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eat an early stage in product development, as soon as teams have an idea of how they expect their product to work, to help shape the product. You can create your model late in the discovery phase if you are using an agile delivery process.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eat a later stage in product development, to help inform the evaluation plan.

The other elements – hypothesis, assumptions, context and barriers – sit around this central model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dc29a93ed915d394cce90ec/Evaluation_Diagrams_v2.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may have large-scale long-term outcomes in mind, but for the purpose of the model, keep the outcomes as specific and focused as possible. It’s important to identify specific outcomes that will be measurable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"functions\"\u003eFunctions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFunctions are things the product does to lead the user towards outcomes that will improve their health. For example, ‘the product breaks down the goal of increasing fitness levels into manageable steps’. Your product will probably have several functions, leading to different responses and outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"responses\"\u003eResponses\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResponses are how your user responds to the functions. This will often be a change in their behaviour. For example, ‘the user feels confident enough to start following the programme’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"outcomes\"\u003eOutcomes\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow does the team expect their digital health product to improve the public’s health or wellbeing? Health outcomes are the changes they are trying to bring about in their users’ health or wellbeing. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eshort-term outcome: user increases amount of exercise they do each week\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003emedium-term outcome: user has improved fitness levels\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003elong-term outcome: user maintains good fitness levels\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDigital health products and services ultimately want to help the user to be healthier and live longer through long-term outcomes such as reducing their risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor this to happen, the user needs to attain some behavioural outcomes by engaging with your digital product. For example, they might increase their activity, lose weight, and better manage their stress levels. These are examples of medium-term outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeasuring engagement with your digital product, such as downloads and usage, is a short-term outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResponses and short-term outcomes – proximal outcomes – are often easier to measure and easier to see a change on than longer-term outcomes – distal outcomes. Laying out which outcomes are which helps the team to decide between different sorts of evaluation, weighing the cost and difficulty of doing the evaluation against the rigour of its findings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"hypothesis\"\u003eHypothesis\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExplain the problem that you are trying to solve or the opportunity you are exploring.

For example, you might assume they want to change their behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"organise-the-workshop\"\u003eOrganise the workshop\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDecide who needs to be involved in your workshop. Involve key members of your team who will bring different expertise and perspectives. A group size between 3 and 8 works well. If you have a larger group, you may need to split into sub-groups for the exercises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eArrange a time when you can meet for 1 to 2 hours. You’ll need sticky notes and pens. Print out the templates in the download below and stick them on the walls. You can also run a workshop online. There are several free online notepads that let groups collaborate on notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve created an optional template for the workshop which you can download and print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dfa044240f0b60948b225ba/Hold_a_workshop_to_model_how_your_product_works_-_downloadable_template_PDF.pdf\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--custom\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dfa0442ed915d0931d74798/thumbnail_Hold_a_workshop_to_model_how_your_product_works_-_downloadable_template_PDF.pdf.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5dfa044240f0b60948b225ba/Hold_a_workshop_to_model_how_your_product_works_-_downloadable_template_PDF.pdf\"\u003eHold a workshop to model how your product works – downloadable template PDF, 54.5KB\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e54.5 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e11 pages\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"introduce-the-activity\"\u003eIntroduce the activity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExplain the purpose of creating a model to show how your product is expected to work.

In the middle, from left to right, stick up functions, responses and outcomes (short-term, medium-term, long-term). Your product will probably have several functions, leading to different responses and outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStick up the other headings – hypothesis, assumptions, context and barriers – around the central model.\nIf you’re running the workshop online, create boxes or columns in your online notepad for each section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fill-out-sections\"\u003eFill out sections\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse the headings (functions, responses, outcomes) and questions in the downloadable PDF template (link above) to guide you. Put your answers on sticky notes so they can be moved around easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEncourage workshop attendees to talk to each other as they do this, especially if you’re conducting the workshop online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApproach the sections in roughly the following order. Consider the hypothesis, assumptions, context and barriers. Then think about the start and end points in how your product works: the outcomes and the functions. Once you have recorded these, consider how the functions lead to the responses and outcomes. Refer back to the hypothesis, assumptions, context and barriers when appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your product is trying to change behaviour, you may want to describe how the functions of your product use appropriate techniques based on behaviour change theory.

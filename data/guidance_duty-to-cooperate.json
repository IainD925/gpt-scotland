The involvement of infrastructure providers in Local Plan preparation is critical to ensure that Local Plans are deliverable. Participation in the Local Plan preparation process in turn helps them to inform their business plans and to plan and finance the delivery of infrastructure that they have a legal obligation to provide. It is expected that private utility companies and providers will engage positively in the preparation and delivery of Local Plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 013 Reference ID: 9-013-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"does-the-duty-to-cooperate-require-cooperation-in-2-tier-local-planning-authority-areas\"\u003eDoes the duty to cooperate require cooperation in 2-tier local planning authority areas?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose cooperation between district local planning authorities and county councils in 2-tier local planning authority areas will be critical to ensure that both tiers are effective when planning for strategic matters such as minerals, waste, transport and education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 014 Reference ID: 9-014-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-local-planning-authorities-decide-who-to-cooperate-with\"\u003eHow do local planning authorities decide who to cooperate with?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe local planning authorities and public bodies that a local planning authority needs to cooperate with will depend on the strategic matters that the local planning authority is planning for and the most appropriate functional geography to gather evidence and develop planning policies. For example housing market and travel to work areas, river catchments and landscape areas may be a more appropriate basis on which to plan than individual local planning authority areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to adopt a pragmatic approach in deciding the area over which cooperation is needed and who to work with. For some strategic matters the most effective outcomes may be achieved through cooperation by a small number of neighbouring local planning authorities while for other matters there may be a need for cooperation over a wider functional area involving both neighbouring and other local planning authorities and bodies. Cooperation between different tiers – counties and districts – may be needed on issues such as transport, waste and flood risk. This will be decided by the particular issues and local planning authorities may well work in different groupings for different strategic matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 015 Reference ID: 9-015-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"relevant-Local-Plans-are-adopted\"\u003eHow can 2 or more local planning authorities cooperate on Local Plan preparation in order to comply with the duty?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere 2 or more local planning authorities decide to work together to prepare Local Plans or policies they should consider how to achieve this most effectively. For some authorities the most appropriate way might be to form a joint committee (to include one or more county councils) under \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/5/section/29\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 29 of the 2004 Act\u003c/a\u003e. Alternatively, the local planning authorities could prepare a joint plan, using powers in \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/5/section/28\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esection 28 of the 2004 Act\u003c/a\u003e, or align their Local Plans, so that they are examined and adopted at broadly the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese options will maximise opportunities for successful joint working and demonstrate a real commitment to effective strategic planning. It would also provide the most certainty for communities and those investing in economic development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way to demonstrate effective cooperation, particularly if Local Plans are not being brought forward at the same time, is the use of formal agreements between local planning authorities, signed by elected members, demonstrating their long term commitment to a jointly agreed strategy on cross boundary matters. Such agreements should be as specific as possible, for example about the quantity, location and timing of unmet housing need that one authority is prepared to accept from another authority to help it deliver its planning strategy. This will be important to demonstrate the commitment between local planning authorities to produce effective strategic planning policies, and it will be helpful for Inspectors to see such agreements at the examination as part of the evidence to demonstrate compliance with the duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal planning authorities considering how to comply with the duty should discuss joint working with the Planning Inspectorate at an early stage. The Planning Inspectorate will aim to facilitate effective joint working by, for example, appointing the same Inspector to undertake the examinations consecutively or a team of Inspectors who will ensure that the respective Local Plans are coordinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 016 Reference ID: 9-016-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"if-local-planning-authorities-want-to-agree-a-joint-planning-strategy-but-are-at-different-stages-of-local-plan-preparation-what-should-they-do\"\u003eIf local planning authorities want to agree a joint planning strategy but are at different stages of Local Plan preparation what should they do?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Local Plans are not being taken forward in the same broad time frame, the respective local planning authorities should try to enter into formal agreements, signed by their elected members, demonstrating their long term commitment to a jointly agreed strategy on cross boundary matters.

Local planning authorities should bear in mind that a failure to demonstrate compliance with the duty at the Local Plan examination cannot be corrected after the Local Plan has been submitted for examination. If an Inspector finds that the duty has not been complied with they will not be able to recommend that the plan is adopted. In this context the most appropriate course of action is likely to be for the local planning authority to withdraw the plan and engage in the necessary discussions and actions with other relevant local planning authorities and partners. The precise stage of the plan preparation process that the local planning authority will need to go back to will depend on the specific facts of the case. But the revised plan will need to be re-published for consultation and comment before being re-submitted for examination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 018 Reference ID: 9-018-20140306\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 06 03 2014\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-will-the-planning-inspectorate-test-a-local-plan-where-the-evidence-suggests-that-the-local-planning-authoritys-planning-strategy-cannot-be-delivered-fully-because-it-has-been-unable-to-secure-the-cooperation-of-another-local-planning-authority\"\u003eHow will the Planning Inspectorate test a Local Plan where the evidence suggests that the local planning authority’s planning strategy cannot be delivered fully because it has been unable to secure the cooperation of another local planning authority?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will depend on the particular circumstances and issues.

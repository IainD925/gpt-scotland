In coming to a view about how well a landlord is delivering the outcomes of our standards, we consider the fairness of the decision that results in a new or updated regulatory judgement as well as those which do not result in a regulatory judgement.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-we-publish-regulatory-judgements\"\u003eWhen we publish regulatory judgements \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor all large landlords, we publish regulatory judgements following our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/our-approach-to-inspections\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eprogrammed inspections\u003c/a\u003e, which include a summary of the inspection findings.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor large private registered providers, we usually reflect our view of how well they are delivering the outcomes of our Rent Standard and Value for Money Standard as part of our view of their delivery of the outcomes of our Governance and Financial Viability Standard. In some circumstances we may publish a separate statement about our view on rents or value for money in a regulatory judgement.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regular-reviews-between-programmed-inspections\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003estability check\u003c/a\u003e, for landlords who have a G1/2 or V1/2 grade where we have not identified that there are any material risks which may result in a change to their financial viability or governance gradings, we reflect this by updating the publication date next to a landlord’s existing grade. We are transparent that this has occurred as a result of the stability check process. We may also update the regulatory judgement. Where a landlord has a G3/4 or V3/4 grade, and we identify material risks which might affect their grading or regulatory judgement we share this intelligence with regulatory staff who are already working with that landlord. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe update our published regulatory judgement of a landlord where our engagement with them leads to a change in our view, or where new issues need to be reflected in our regulatory judgement following a period of engagement with them. We set out our approach to interim judgements below. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor landlords of any size or type, we may publish decisions about serious failings in relation to any standard in a regulatory judgement. This applies whether or not we issue grades for that landlord or standard. Where we publish a regulatory judgement that there are weaknesses or failings in the landlord’s delivery of the outcomes of our standards, this published judgement will remain in effect until the landlord has given us evidence which gives us assurance that the relevant weaknesses or failings have been addressed to our satisfaction. Only at that point would we replace it with a new judgement.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a programmed inspection, we publish a regulatory judgement and grade for large landlords. Alongside that, where we follow up on issues through our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/responsive-engagement-with-landlords\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eresponsive engagement\u003c/a\u003e, we carry out an inspection outside of our programme of inspections, or when investigating issues where there are serious failures in a landlord delivering the outcomes of our standards, we may reach a view that results in us publishing a regulatory judgement and where appropriate a consumer grade. We make clear which route we have used to inform our judgement and grading. We also make clear in the published regulatory judgement where we are issuing a grade, where the grade is based on the outcome of work which is narrow in scope for example where we have focused on one or more specific issues of concern and is not as a result of carrying out a more rounded assessment of the landlord’s delivery of the outcomes of the consumer standards overall.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"governance-viability-and-consumer-grades\"\u003eGovernance, viability and consumer grades \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur regulatory judgements include one or more grades for all large landlords.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFor private registered providers, these grades are our view of how well they are delivering the outcomes of the Governance and Financial Viability Standard and the consumer standards.  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFor local authority landlords, this grade is our view of how well they are delivering the outcomes of the consumer standards.  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe do not issue grades to small landlords.

Regulatory judgements relating to for-profit landlords include an explanatory statement to make it clear that our view relates to the registered for-profit landlord only. It does not represent an assessment of non-registered entities within any group or the ability of such entities to provide support to the registered for-profit landlord, although we do consider the risks to the registered for-profit landlord from its relationships with any wider group.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo provide further clarity we use an asterisk with a for-profit landlord’s grade (for example, G1\u003cem\u003e, V1\u003c/em\u003e, C2*) to make it clear that the assessment refers to a landlord that is designated on the register as being for-profit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"interim-judgements-and-gradings\"\u003eInterim judgements and gradings   \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere two or more existing landlords merge or a landlord undergoes what we judge to be a significant constitutional change or restructure, we may issue an interim regulatory judgement.

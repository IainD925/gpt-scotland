Previously, the nationally administered model required institutions to verify local availability of the substantial qualification with each student’s home local authority. This process was cumbersome and resulted in inconsistent decisions being taken about which students were and were not eligible for \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e. In the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the process was changed so verification was undertaken directly by Education Funding Agency (EFA).

Any such support must be a genuine exception; EFA does not expect such support to be given from \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e funding on a routine basis.

For the purposes of \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e eligibility, the key element of the study programme is the substantial qualification that is being funded by EFA, not the study programme as a whole/the combination of different modules within it.

For students who are continuing on a substantial qualification already verified with EFA (returning for their second or subsequent year), no further verification of the qualification is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must have an unconditional offer of a place before they submit an application to the institution for \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e support.

The methodology takes account of the number of eligible students who received \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e support and who will be returning in the 2016 to 2017 academic year multiplied by the maximum permitted funding amount per student (as set out in the Household Income section of this guide).  An amount of funding has then been added to this total to make funds available for any eligible new students in the 2016 to 2017 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnly institutions with new \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e supported students in the 2015 to 2016 academic year have been given a funding allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions without an \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e allocation in the 2016 to 2017 academic year that are approached by a student for help with residential costs should follow the normal EFA business case process to request an allocation. The business case should provide the student(s) home postcode and details of their substantial Level 2 or 3 qualifications (including qualification reference number) to enable EFA to check if the student is eligible (subject to the institution’s assessment of their household income etc).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should use the funding allocated to them for \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e solely to support eligible students with residential costs in line with the \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e scheme rules. The funding cannot be used for any other purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"data-and-management-information-requirements\"\u003eData and management information requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEFA will ask institutions to complete a short management information return in October to report the number of new and returning students who received \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e and the amount of funding spent. As is the case with the residential bursary fund, any unspent funds will be recovered. Data supplied in this return will be crucial to the generation of future allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the longer term, EFA will use data from the ILR (Learner Funding and Monitoring (FAM); learner support reason) to identify students who have been assessed as eligible for \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e and who have taken up the funding to generate subsequent allocations. Institutions are strongly encouraged to complete these fields. EFA will review data periodically throughout the year including R14. This information will enable the development of \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e policy and help target \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"audit-requirements\"\u003eAudit requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should maintain accurate and up to date records to evidence which students get \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e funding; show that students are eligible for funding and show appropriate use of funds. The sections on \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e applications and verification of the student’s substantial qualification also highlight a number of points for institutions to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe administration and allocation of \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e is subject to the institution’s normal governance and audit regimes. \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e funding is also subject to EFA checks using data submitted as part of the \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e process (to verify student eligibility) and external visits as part of the normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions should note that, following an audit/check, funding may be recovered where \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e payments are found not to have been made in accordance with this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions who would like further information about \u003cabbr title=\"Residential Support Scheme\"\u003eRSS\u003c/abbr\u003e in the 2016 to 2017 academic year, should contact:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"contact contact\" id=\"contact_2538\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eESFA enquiries\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n\n        \u003cp class=\"govuk-!-margin-bottom-4\"\u003e\n          Contact form \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json\u0026amp;redirectlink=%2Fen\u0026amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen\u0026amp;consentMessage=yes\"\u003ehttps://form.education...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eFor all enquiries for the Education and Skills Funding Agency\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

For digital products, they can be quick and cheap if you can use data that is already being collected. Sometimes you will want to collect additional data specifically for the evaluation. This may cost more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost descriptive studies use quantitative methods, but some are qualitative or incorporate qualitative methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-use-them\"\u003eWhen to use them\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse them when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyour product is in use, to check it works and has no unintended consequences (ex-post evaluation)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyour product is about to be in use and can be tested with a pilot group to see how it works in practice\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"questions-they-answer\"\u003eQuestions they answer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow many people are using your product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow many people stay engaged with your product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow often do they use it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDo they like the product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"descriptive-study-methods\"\u003eDescriptive study methods\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/analysis-of-routinely-collected-data-descriptive-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAnalysis of routinely collected data\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-change-techniques-review-descriptive-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBehaviour change techniques review\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/clinical-audit-descriptive-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eClinical audit\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/user-feedback-study-descriptive-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUser feedback study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"comparative-studies\"\u003e2.

If this product didn’t exist, what would have happened? The alternative might be nothing, an existing non-digital service, or a different digital product or service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, a group of people who have some anxiety problems use your new app. Six months later, 30% report they no longer have anxiety problems. Does this prove that the app is effective? No. Some people recover from anxiety problems over time without outside assistance. You need to compare whether more people recovered using the app than would have without the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComparative studies usually involve collecting quantitative data on individuals who are not given your product. This is more complex and expensive than a typical descriptive study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice of comparison is important. Some comparisons are easier and cheaper to make, but may not be fair. You will have to find a balance between a very robust evaluation and what is practical and affordable. \nSome types of comparative study are very robust.

Qualitative methods can give a richer explanation of what is happening. For example, a quantitative approach could describe patterns of disengagement with an app and what demographic factors predict disengagement, but a qualitative approach can describe why users stopped using the app. It could also focus on giving a voice to particular users who might otherwise be overlooked in evaluations. Qualitative studies may be more subjective than quantitative studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile qualitative studies can describe the range of views among participants, they are weak at saying how many participants hold different views. Results from qualitative studies are hard to generalise to other participants. \nThe number of participants needed can be much lower than for other evaluation methods. However, the amount of information you get from each participant can be much higher, so usually more time is spent with each participant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-use-them-2\"\u003eWhen to use them\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse them when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou want a more in-depth understanding of users’ thoughts and experiences of your product\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou’re developing your product, to work out how to improve it (formative or iterative evaluation)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou have open-ended questions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"questions-they-answer-2\"\u003eQuestions they answer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was users’ overall experience of the product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow did users feel during their journey through the product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do users want to see in a new version of the product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"qualitative-study-methods\"\u003eQualitative study methods\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contextual-inquiry\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eContextual inquiry\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ethnographic-study-qualitative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEthnographic study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/focus-group-study-qualitative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFocus group study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/interview-study-qualitative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eInterview study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/think-aloud-study-qualitative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThink aloud study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/usability-testing-qualitative-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUsability testing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"health-economic-studies\"\u003e4.

It provides information about the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of your product to help inform decisions about which digital health interventions to provide. Economic evaluation enables decision-makers to make efficient use of available resources for improving a population’s health. Pursuing efficiency involves maximising the benefits of the available resources, not just reducing costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBudget impact analysis evaluates the affordability of a digital health product given the available budget constraints. This involves a comprehensive assessment of the costs and savings of implementing a new digital health product. Budget impact analysis usually complements value for money assessments and is often conducted after an economic evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHealth economic studies can tell you whether the benefits of investing in your product exceed the benefits you would have got from investing the same amount in an alternative option. For example, if you are launching a new mobile app to facilitate remote GP consultations, economic evaluation will tell you whether your product provides most benefits for each additional pound invested in it compared to competing options. The alternative options could be other mobile apps or face-to-face appointments. It will also tell you about the likely cost implications of rolling out your product within the decision-maker’s available budget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-use-them-3\"\u003eWhen to use them\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUse them when:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyour product is being launched or tested in a pilot study to help guide decisions about whether it should be adopted\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou want to understand how your product compares with competing alternatives in terms of both benefits and costs\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou need to know whether your product offers the most benefits given the available budget\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou need a more comprehensive assessment of the broader economic implications of your product, and its impact on the decision-maker’s budget\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"questions-they-answer-3\"\u003eQuestions they answer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow much benefit is gained for each additional pound invested in your product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow cost-effective is your product compared to alternative options when competing for local or national resources?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs the adoption and spread of your product feasible within the decision-maker’s available budget?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"economic-study-methods\"\u003eEconomic study methods\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/budget-impact-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eBudget impact analysis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/economic-evaluation-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEconomic evaluation\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-consequence-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost consequence analysis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-effectiveness-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost effectiveness analysis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-utility-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost utility analysis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-benefit-analysis-health-economic-studies\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecost benefit analysis\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"approaches-that-cut-across-categories\"\u003eApproaches that cut across categories\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe categorisation in this guide is one way of classifying different methods.

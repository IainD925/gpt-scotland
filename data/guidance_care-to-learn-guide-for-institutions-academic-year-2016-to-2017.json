It provides funding for childcare whilst the young parent is engaged in a study programme and is not able to provide care for their child. Care to Learn can also help with the cost of associated travel. The scheme can provide up to a maximum total amount of £160 per child per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child per week in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe young parent’s study programme must have some public funding. Care to Learn will only fund childcare provision that is registered with Ofsted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo receive Care to Learn, young parents, their education institution and their childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria set out below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents must complete and submit a new application for each academic year they want to claim Care to Learn funding, even if their study programme runs for more than one year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents are encouraged to apply for Care to Learn before the start of their study programme or as soon as possible after they start. It is important that young parents are aware that payments can only be backdated to the start of their study programme if their application is received within 28 days of the start date. Payments for any applications received outside of this timeframe will begin from the Monday of the week in which the application was received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents can apply before their baby is born, but their application cannot be fully assessed until all the child’s details have been provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders are encouraged to tell young parents about the availability of financial support for childcare through Care to Learn to help them make more informed decisions about their options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"care-to-learn-eligibility-criteria\"\u003eCare to Learn eligibility criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to receive support from Care to Learn, the young parent, their education institution and childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme as set out below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe young parent must be under 20 years old on the date they start their study programme.

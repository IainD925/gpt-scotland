Like other business assets you can get insurance to protect against risks associated with your \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e. Much of this insurance (but not all) is aimed at businesses who have already secured \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e rights. However, you can also protect yourself against inadvertently infringing the rights of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo decide if your business could benefit from investing in \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e insurance you firstly need to recognise, understand and if appropriate, protect your \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e. The Intellectual Property Office (\u003cabbr title=\"Intellectual Property Office\"\u003eIPO\u003c/abbr\u003e) has a range of \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intellectual-property-for-business\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efree online tools\u003c/a\u003e to help you understand more about trade marks, designs, patents and copyright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-before-the-event-ip-legal-expenses-insurance\"\u003eWhat is before the event \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e legal expenses insurance?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e‘Before the event’ or ‘\u003cabbr title=\"before the event\"\u003eBTE\u003c/abbr\u003e’ legal expenses insurance (\u003cabbr title=\"legal expenses insurance\"\u003eLEI\u003c/abbr\u003e) policies can cover you against your own legal costs and/or the legal costs of someone you are in dispute with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, \u003cabbr title=\"before the event\"\u003eBTE\u003c/abbr\u003e \u003cabbr title=\"legal expenses insurance\"\u003eLEI\u003c/abbr\u003e will only cover risk before a claim is made or before the possibility of a claim is known about or ought to be known about.

The premiums you pay will reflect the geographical cover you need. Taking out domestic cover early and expanding the cover as your markets grow could be cheaper than taking initial cover for a large geographical area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"is-ip-legal-expenses-insurance-the-same-as-other-types-of-insurance\"\u003eIs \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e legal expenses insurance the same as other types of insurance?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn numerous ways, \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e legal expenses insurance works the same as other types of insurance. For instance, your premiums will be lower or higher depending on the perceived level of risk. If your business is in a sector where the technology is complicated or the market is highly competitive then the risks may be higher. In these sectors you should expect to pay more for a policy and some sectors may not be acceptable risks for insurers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also expect there to be exclusions and excesses in \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e insurance policies. The level of excess, the amount of any claim that you will have to pay before the insurer will begin paying, can sometimes be decided by you. You can use your excess to raise or lower the level of your premium. For the lower indemnity policies, excesses will typically start at £1000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother form of “excess” is co-insurance. This is a percentage of the costs of any claim, which you will have to pay. This means that you share the risk and costs. Insurers believe this can ensure that you more carefully consider your actions before making a claim and/or during a dispute. It is important that you carefully read and understand the policy terms and in particular the exclusion and excess clauses and that you discuss these and their implications with the broker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"benefits-and-costs\"\u003eBenefits and costs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-might-i-purchase-ip-insurance\"\u003eWhy might I purchase \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e Insurance?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e insurance may not be appropriate for every business: the price may be prohibitive because of the perceived risk. However, you may find that \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e insurance has numerous potential benefits for helping protect your business assets:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can protect cash-flow: \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e insurance can ensure that your dispute and particularly litigation, does not tie up capital which you could use to grow the business\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can provide a deterrent: \u003cabbr title=\"legal expenses insurance\"\u003eLEI\u003c/abbr\u003e can give you the power to take action to enforce your rights where your financial position might not otherwise allow it. If a potential infringer knows that your insurance will cover making a claim, then it may be less likely to infringe or more likely they will stop when challenged. Some insurers are happy for you to confirm in marketing literature or on websites that your \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e is insured, alerting competitors that insurance is in place\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit can improve your negotiating position: If this deterrent does not work then the knowledge that you can go to court (as a last resort) can encourage the alleged infringer to negotiate or mediate.

You can now buy policies which require lower levels of financial cover (‘indemnities’) as a result of the clearer costs in the \u003cabbr title=\"Intellectual Property Enterprise Court\"\u003eIPEC\u003c/abbr\u003e. This means that premiums are lower for the levels of cover which these policies provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe insurer will indicate the actual premium once they have received your application. As a rough indication, £100,000 of cover can cost around £1,500 for patents (and less for other rights). Premiums can often be paid in instalments. You can buy these policies for sole use in the \u003cabbr title=\"Intellectual Property Enterprise Court\"\u003eIPEC\u003c/abbr\u003e or you can get similar policies with slightly higher cover which will offer you greater flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePremiums will increase in line with the level of risks. Some types of cover for certain risks and technology sectors will need more careful consideration by insurers, particularly where they require higher levels of cover or wider geographical cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-on-cover-and-claims-process\"\u003eThe on-cover and claims process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-i-get-ip-insurance-cover\"\u003eHow do I get \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e insurance cover?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with other types of commercial insurance, you should consult a specialist broker who will advise you of the appropriate cover (see below). You may save time if you improve your understanding by looking at some of the policy summaries and case studies which are available on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA typical process could take you around 10 days and generally involves:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou completing an application form;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe broker assessing what cover is needed\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe broker getting quotes from one or more insurance partners;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eyou discussing the quotes with the broker and what they mean to your business\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edeciding which policy is best suited to your business.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will usually involve an assessment of the likelihood of you being involved in a dispute. This assessment will not usually be shared with you and could result in cover not being provided. It may not involve assessment of the validity or strength of your right(s) at this point. Remember, cover cannot be provided if you are aware of an ongoing infringement or if you know/believe an infringement is likely to occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-do-i-make-a-claim\"\u003eHow do I make a claim?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step you would take would be to discuss the alleged infringement or dispute with your own lawyer/\u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e attorney. It may be that the assessment could be for them to take initial action or even not to make a claim on the insurance cover at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether that is the case or not, you should make the insurer aware of the potential dispute and that you are considering the way forward. You will not be able to recover any costs you incur before alerting the insurer or without their express agreement. In deciding on your strategy for resolving that particular dispute, you should consider again the policy clauses particularly in relation to your legal representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"can-i-use-my-own-lawyerattorney-to-resolve-the-dispute\"\u003eCan I use my own lawyer/attorney to resolve the dispute?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should check the policy wording before starting any legal action. Sometimes a certain solicitor/patent attorney or one chosen from a panel must be used at least initially. Even if the policy allows you to use your own representative, the insurer will want to know that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to represent you. They will, therefore, be subject to the insurer’s approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome insurers may maintain a list of preferred law firms with whom they will have negotiated an advantageous hourly rate. Using a panel lawyer could mean that the limit of your cover might stretch further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any subsequent dispute around your representative with the insurer which cannot be resolved, then you can ask the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical.htm\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFinancial Ombudsman\u003c/a\u003e to settle the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-the-reasonable-prospect-of-success-test\"\u003eWhat is the ‘reasonable prospect of success test’?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you are insured or not, you will want to understand your dispute, and to assess if it went to court what your likely chance of winning the case would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your policy includes enforcing your rights, insurers will require you to submit a legal opinion from a qualified person, confirming that the chances of successfully enforcing the claim are over 50% or in some cases 60% (this is what insurers call the ‘reasonable prospect of success’ or ‘\u003cabbr title=\"reasonable prospect of success\"\u003eRPS\u003c/abbr\u003e’ test). This is on the basis that no sensible business would pursue a court case if it is more likely to lose than win. Understandably, insurers are unwilling to fund such legal actions. You might consider that if you were not insured, would you think legal action in such a situation, a sensible commercial course?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour advisor will take into account the validity of your right during the assessment of your dispute. It may be that this is not what you expect but understanding it would be necessary for deciding your strategy whether you were insured or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePolicy documents will indicate whether it will be yours or in some cases, the insurer’s responsibility to assess the prospects of success. If the insurers do the assessment and you disagree with it, you should be able to submit an independent view in response. In all situations, you may find that an \u003cabbr title=\"Intellectual Property Office\"\u003eIPO\u003c/abbr\u003e Patent Opinion, which costs only £200, could help towards understanding the dispute and contribute to the \u003cabbr title=\"reasonable prospect of success\"\u003eRPS\u003c/abbr\u003e test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-else-might-i-consider-in-the-policy-wording\"\u003eWhat else might I consider in the policy wording?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe broker will advise you on all aspects of the policy including: what costs are covered if a claim is made and; what the insurer will pay out if your case settles early. The costs you recover will also be subject to any excess and co-insurance and must be reasonably and properly incurred. Sometimes you will need to seek the insurer’s permission on certain costs before they are incurred. Your legal representative will be able to advise you of these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour policy document will set out not only the ‘reasonable prospect of success’ test but also the terms of settling your dispute. The insurer will expect you to make every effort to recover costs from the opponent. In some cases, this can have the potential to lead to differences of opinion between you and insurer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"resolving-ip-disputes-and-next-steps\"\u003eResolving \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e disputes and next steps\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"are-there-cheaper-ways-i-can-better-understand-andor-resolve-my-dispute\"\u003eAre there cheaper ways I can better understand and/or resolve my dispute?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn Opinion from the \u003cabbr title=\"Intellectual Property Office\"\u003eIPO\u003c/abbr\u003e can help you negotiate a settlement or decide whether to proceed with full legal proceedings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn opinion is not binding on you or others involved.

It is cheaper and quicker than litigation and the outcome is usually beneficial to all parties. Most types of \u003cabbr title=\"intellectual property\"\u003eIP\u003c/abbr\u003e dispute are appropriate for mediation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA court will expect you and the other party in dispute to have attempted to resolve matters before starting legal proceedings. It will also expect you to have properly considered a form of \u003cabbr title=\"alternative dispute resolution\"\u003eADR\u003c/abbr\u003e and can impose financial sanctions if you do not.

The EHS covers all housing tenures and provides valuable information and evidence to inform the development and monitoring of DLUHC’s housing policies, including the levels of decency in social housing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 2019 and 2022 the proportion of non-decent social homes decreased from 12% to 10%. While we welcome the improvement in non-decency rates, we know there is more to do and we remain committed to halving the number of non-decent homes in the rented sectors by 2030. Everyone has the right to a safe and decent home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are also reviewing the Decent Homes Standard (DHS) and for the first time extending it to the private rented sector so that all tenants across both tenures are secure in the knowledge that they are living in safe and decent homes. We have tabled amendments to the Renters (Reform) Bill that will enable us to introduce a DHS into the private rented sector for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven though there has been a reduction in the proportion of social housing that is non-decent, cases of damp and mould have increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not acceptable and it’s why we are exploring the merits of a standalone damp and mould standard within the DHS that all landlords, private and social, must meet. Our consolidated guidance on the health impact of damp and mould in homes, tailored to the housing sector, can be found at: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damp-and-mould-understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-for-rented-housing-providers\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDamp and mould: understanding and addressing the health risks for rented housing providers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-sure-tenants-voices-are-heard\"\u003eMaking sure tenants’ voices are heard   \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"resident-panel\"\u003eResident Panel\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn December we published our latest Resident Panel reports on the important topics of repairs, maintenance and Awaab’s Law, and also the experiences of disabled residents in social housing. The reports are available to read at: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-housing-quality-resident-panel-wave-2-reports\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSocial Housing Quality Resident Panel: wave 2 reports\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Resident Panel’s Online Community where they shared their thoughts on their landlord’s role in the local community closed on 3 December. We will publish a report on these findings in the Spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe next Resident Panel activities are two focus groups in January and February to discuss how landlords communicate with residents. Also in January, Panel members will be asked to complete an evaluation of their experience on the Panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"four-million-homes\"\u003eFour Million Homes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fourmillionhomes.org/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFour Million Homes\u003c/a\u003e programme provides free information, guidance, and training on residents’ rights for residents.

It helps residents know their rights and to work with their landlords to help improve the quality of social homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn December we launched a series of brand-new training videos. They are available online so that as many social housing residents as possible can have access to this important training, at a time to suit them.

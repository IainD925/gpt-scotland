It is passed on through blood, semen and vaginal fluids. An estimated 206,000 people are living with \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-b-in-england\"\u003echronic hepatitis B infection in England\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of cases are in migrants who have acquired infection overseas in endemic countries prior to arrival in the UK. Communities at higher risk of getting hepatitis B in the UK include people who inject drugs, gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men who are having sex with multiple partners, sex workers and people detained in prisons or immigration detention centres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePregnant women who have hepatitis B can pass the infection onto their baby around the time of birth – this is one of the most common routes of infection globally. To reduce the chances of a baby developing the infection, since the late 1990s all pregnant women in England have been offered an antenatal blood test for hepatitis B (as well as \u003cabbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\"\u003eHIV\u003c/abbr\u003e and syphilis).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor women who test positive for hepatitis B, their newborn babies are offered a course of hepatitis B vaccination starting at birth. In addition to the targeted infant vaccination programme, in 2017 the UK introduced universal infant hepatitis B immunisation within the 6-in-1 vaccine at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021 quarterly coverage for these 3 doses was 91 to 92 per cent, exceeding the \u003cabbr title=\"World Health Organization\"\u003eWHO\u003c/abbr\u003e target of 90%. Through this successful 3-pronged approach, England has now met the \u003cabbr title=\"World Health Organization\"\u003eWHO\u003c/abbr\u003e criteria for elimination of mother to child transmission. Achieving this is a key milestone in the \u003cabbr title=\"World Health Organization\"\u003eWHO\u003c/abbr\u003e’s strategy for the overall elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the risk of hepatitis B in the UK is low, the UK Health Security Agency (\u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e) continues to encourage all those eligible to take up vaccination in order to lower the risk of themselves or their children becoming seriously ill in future. This includes people who have ever injected drugs, gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who have immigrated to the UK from countries where hepatitis is common and pregnant women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside hepatitis B, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-c-in-the-uk\"\u003eprogress towards eliminating hepatitis C\u003c/a\u003e as a public health problem by 2030 in England continues. Hepatitis C is passed on in similar ways to hepatitis B infection, but there is no vaccine. Latest modelling suggests that 92,900 people were living with hepatitis C in the UK at the end of 2021 – a decline of 47.2% since 2015. Thanks to increased testing and curative treatments, the UK is on track to achieve 2030 \u003cabbr title=\"World Health Organization\"\u003eWHO\u003c/abbr\u003e elimination goal for \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis C\"\u003ehep C\u003c/abbr\u003e based on current trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDr Sema Mandal, Deputy Director for Blood Borne Viruses at \u003cabbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\"\u003eUKHSA\u003c/abbr\u003e, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWith the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B, very low hepatitis related death rates and continued reduction of chronic hepatitis C levels, we are on our way to our goal of eliminating hepatitis B and C in England by 2030.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eTesting, vaccination for hepatitis B and curative treatments for hepatitis C have all played a significant role in driving down these infections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eMany people are unaware they have hepatitis because the viruses can be symptomless – meaning they aren’t getting the treatments they need and are possibly passing the virus on to others without knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eWe continue to urge all those who have ever injected drugs, gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, sex workers and people who have immigrated to the UK from countries where hepatitis B or C is common to come forward for free testing, treatment or hepatitis B vaccination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSecretary of State for Health and Social Care Steve Barclay said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe are paving the way for the elimination of hepatitis B and C, with England set to be one of the first countries in the world to wipe out these viruses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eDeaths and prevalence of hepatitis C have fallen consistently thanks to improvements in diagnosis and access to highly effective treatments that are available on the NHS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThis is another example of how we’re at the forefront of tackling serious diseases, through swiftly procuring the best treatments and tackling inequalities through testing and vaccination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Stewart, Director for Specialised Commissioning and interim Director of Commercial Medicines at NHS England, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe are pleased \u003cabbr title=\"World Health Organization\"\u003eWHO\u003c/abbr\u003e has confirmed England has eliminated mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B, thanks to universal screening and immunisation benefitting more than 9 in 10 infants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe NHS is committed to increasing early detection diagnoses of blood-borne viruses, including rolling out opt-out testing for \u003cabbr title=\"human immunodeficiency virus\"\u003eHIV\u003c/abbr\u003e, \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis C\"\u003ehep C\u003c/abbr\u003e and \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B\"\u003ehep B\u003c/abbr\u003e in A\u0026amp;Es – building on the testing already routinely available through GPs and sexual health services across the country – and ensuring people have access to treatments and specialist support as early as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThrough screening programmes and national medicines deals that give NHS patients access to the latest drugs, England is also on track to become the first country to eliminate hepatitis C, which will be a landmark international achievement in public health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePamela Healy OBE, Chief Executive, British Liver Trust, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eIt is excellent news that England has met the ambitious target set by \u003cabbr title=\"World Health Organization\"\u003eWHO\u003c/abbr\u003e and eliminated the transmission of Hepatitis B between mothers and children. The challenge now is for us to find the thousands of people living in England who have hepatitis but are completely unaware of it.

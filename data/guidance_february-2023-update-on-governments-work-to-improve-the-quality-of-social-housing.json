The amendment will require social landlords to fix hazards, such as damp and mould, in their homes within strict time limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amendment is in memory of 2 year old Awaab Ishak, who tragically died from exposure to damp and mould in his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Housing Secretary announced the news at a meeting with Awaab Ishak’s family in Rochdale, where he thanked them for their tireless campaigning and fight for justice. The family welcomed the government’s action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secretary of State also met with Rochdale Boroughwide Housing to discuss improvements they are making to their governance and services, in response to failings that led to the tragic death of Awaab Ishak. The government continues to block funding to Rochdale Boroughwide Housing to build new homes until it can prove it is a responsible landlord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government continues to progress the Social Housing (Regulation) Bill through Parliament. The Bill’s next step is Report Stage on 1 March where amendments to the Bill, including Awaab’s Law, will be debated in the House of Commons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"awaabs-law\"\u003eAwaab’s law\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Coroner’s report on the death of Awaab Ishak found that no action was taken by their housing association (Rochdale Boroughwide Housing) to treat and prevent the mould that led to the tragic death of the 2-year old. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/secretary-of-state-statement-on-social-housing-standards.\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe Housing Secretary has been clear that his death should never have happened\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAwaab’s Law will require all landlords to investigate and fix reported hazards in their homes within a specified time frame, or rehouse tenants where a home cannot be made safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new rules will form part of the social housing tenancy agreement, so tenants can hold landlords to account through the courts if they fail to provide a decent home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government will launch a consultation later this year to set the timeframes within which landlords will have to act to investigate hazards and make repairs. This will help to make sure that the new requirements for landlords lead to the right outcomes for tenants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAwaab’s Law will then be introduced via secondary legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"professionalisation\"\u003eProfessionalisation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, the government tabled an amendment to the Social Housing (Regulation) Bill, which will require all social housing managers to have a professional qualification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 25,000 managers across the sector will have to hold an appropriate level housing management qualification regulated by Ofqual equivalent to a Level 4 or 5 Certificate or Diploma in Housing, or a foundation degree from the Chartered Institute of Housing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe change will help to protect residents and raise standards, ensuring residents receive a high level of service and are treated with respect at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will also bring social housing more closely into line with other sectors providing front line services, including social work, teaching, and health and care services. Any landlord who fails to meet the requirements of the new standards could receive an unlimited fine from the regulator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"consumer-rights-and-regulation\"\u003eConsumer rights and regulation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Social Housing (Regulation) Bill will bring about the greatest overhaul of social housing regulation in over a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"housing-ombudsman\"\u003eHousing Ombudsman\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Bill, the Housing Ombudsman will receive new powers to hold landlords to account. As part of this, we have now introduced an amendment to the Bill that will help ensure landlords learn from past mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ombudsman will have the power to instruct landlords to measure their service against guidance on problems like damp and mould, to help improve their response to complaints from tenants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-regulator-of-social-housing\"\u003eThe Regulator of Social Housing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bill will also strengthen the Regulator of Social Housing, including new powers to issue unlimited fines to landlords that fail to meet standards in their homes and make emergency repairs where serious risks to tenants are found, with landlords footing the bill. The Regulator has now published their \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reshaping-consumer-regulation-our-implementation-plan\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eimplementation plan\u003c/a\u003e for the new consumer regulation regime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also recently published \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damp-and-mould-in-social-housing-initial-findings\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003einitial findings on damp and mould\u003c/a\u003e, after collecting data from social landlords across England. This showed that between 1-2% of social homes (40,000 to 80,000) are estimated to have serious damp and mould problems, and a further 3-4% (120,000 to 160,000) to have notable damp and mould. The Regulator will be taking action against landlords that reported high numbers of damp and mould cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"consultation-launch\"\u003eConsultation launch\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Housing Secretary has the power to direct the Regulator of Social Housing on some part of the standards it sets for social landlords. We have launched a technical consultation on updating two of our directions for the Regulator that will make sure tenants’ voices are heard and strengthen their access to existing rights:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTenant involvement:\u003c/strong\u003e under the proposed changes, landlords will have to make sure all tenants have the chances to engage with their landlords in a meaningful way. Landlords will also have to give tenants greater opportunities to scrutinise their service and offer support so all tenants can get involved, through activities like tenant groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMutual exchange:\u003c/strong\u003e Tenants have the right to use a service that helps them exchange their home with other social housing tenants. We want to strengthen this service by giving providers more freedom in how they allow tenants to access it, and by requiring landlords to support tenants who may struggle to use the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find more information on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revised-directions-to-regulator-of-social-housing-tenant-involvement-and-mutual-exchange\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003econsultation and submit responses\u003c/a\u003e.

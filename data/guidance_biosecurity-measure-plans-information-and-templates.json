Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe application of biosecurity in aquaculture is a shared responsibility where each individual involved plays a different but critical role in the implementation of the overall programme. In order to be effective, biosecurity is necessary at all levels within the aquaculture industry, from the control of the spread of infectious disease at an international level to the development of national controls and to the operation of suitable practices at a local level. In these terms, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) monitors the international status of diseases, our Government (through Cefas) is responsible for controlling biosecurity within national limits, and at a local level Aquaculture Production Businesses (APBs) are responsible for biosecurity within their enterprises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe key elements of biosecurity include: practical and appropriate legislative controls, adequate diagnostic and detection methods for infectious diseases, disinfection and pathogen eradication methods, reliable high quality sources of stock, and best management practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the local level, implementation of an effective biosecurity measures plan is essential in reducing the risk of disease introduction to an APB. This follows the fundamental principle that prevention is better than the cure. In addition, it is widely accepted that prevention of aquatic animal disease is cheaper than the cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aquatic Animal Health (England and Wales) Regulations 2009 recognises the importance of effective biosecurity measures in restricting the spread of disease. It requires APB operators to implement a biosecurity measures plan as a condition of their authorisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese guidelines are designed to help the APB operator identify biosecurity measures that might be applicable to their site. It describes biosecurity measures that can be implemented and includes templates (based on an APB’s activities) to enable APB operators to develop and operate a meaningful plan of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appointing-a-biosecurity-manager\"\u003e2. Appointing a Biosecurity Manager\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdentify an individual with the responsibility to ensure biosecurity measures are implemented at an APB, or over several APBs if the business is made up of more than one site. The biosecurity manager is responsible for producing and maintaining a biosecurity measures plan, as well as demonstrating its effectiveness through use of good record keeping (see Section 7). Additional responsibilities include ensuring staff are trained in biosecurity issues and visitors are aware of measures that apply to them. It is good practice to appoint a deputy in the event that the manager is unavailable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"veterinary-health-contacts\"\u003e3. Veterinary Health Contacts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biosecurity manager should identify a veterinarian, and if appropriate an aquatic animal health consultant with specialised knowledge of aquatic animal health issues. The manager should endeavour to establish a good working relationship with their nominated veterinary professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"providing-staff-training-in-aquatic-animal-health-management-and-disease-recognition\"\u003e4. Providing Staff Training in Aquatic Animal Health Management and Disease Recognition\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA fundamental requirement when identifying risks to your APB is an awareness of the following: diseases that can affect your stock, clinical signs of disease, host susceptibility and the range of environmental parameters that could precipitate clinical outbreaks. You are legally obliged to report suspicion of listed diseases in aquatic animals to the Fish Health Inspectorate, for more information see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-serious-fish-or-shellfish-diseases\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eListed diseases of fish, molluscs and crustacea and their status\u003c/a\u003e. Staff training and periodic refresher courses will facilitate better disease recognition in aquatic animals stocks, and informed and trained staff will be of greater benefit to the business. Training should be through continuous learning rather than a one-off exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInformation on aquatic animal diseases can be obtained from a variety of sources:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ethe Fish Health Inspectorate\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eattendance at short courses or completion of distance learning courses on aquatic animal health and disease\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003etextbooks\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003edisease recognition leaflets and posters\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003einternet – further information on these resources is available on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/fish-health-inspectorate\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCefas Fish Health Inspectorate\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eveterinarians and aquatic animal health professionals\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003econferences and meetings\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"identify-the-risks-of-contracting-and-spreading-disease\"\u003e5.

Accurate recording will aid the biosecurity manager to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions when a disease or breach of biosecurity occurs. A comprehensive log or diary can be used to demonstrate to interested parties (customers, senior management, auditors, quality management and inspection agencies) that a biosecurity measures plan is in operation.

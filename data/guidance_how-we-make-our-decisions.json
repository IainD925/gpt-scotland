The sentences dealt with by the Parole Board include life sentences, indeterminate sentences for public protection, some fixed sentences and recall cases (meaning that the offender was previously released but has been subsequently returned to prison custody). The Parole Board can also advise on moves of some prisoners from a closed to an open prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe parole process is complicated. It usually takes 6 months, but can sometimes take longer. The first stage of all parole reviews consists of one Parole Board member reviewing the prisoner’s dossier. The dossier is a collection of documents about the prisoner, including reports and information about their offending, progress made in custody and their risk management plan. Using the information contained in the dossier, the member will either decide that the case requires an oral hearing or give a negative decision. In some cases, the member can recommend a transfer to open conditions and for certain types of sentence they can release a prisoner based on the information in the dossier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an oral hearing is required, this will be conducted by a panel. The panel can be made up of one, two or three members. They will meet with the prisoner and other witnesses who will give evidence on the risk the prisoner poses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/parole-board-decision-making-framework\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edecision-making process\u003c/a\u003e is complex, with many different factors to consider. Not all decisions made by members will be popular despite them remaining as fair and objective as they can. They will consider a wide range of evidence before arriving at a decision, including the original evidence of offending, sentencing remarks and evidence of changes in behaviour and attitude achieved through the offender completing programmes whilst in custody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-do-parole-board-members-consider\"\u003eWhat do Parole Board members consider?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to assess the risk posed by a particular offender, members are looking for evidence that their behaviour has changed since their offence was committed. Things that they might take into account include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat was it about their situation that led to offending behaviour? Have they addressed those issues?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIf they had a chaotic lifestyle previously (e.g. misusing drugs or alcohol) have they worked to address this?\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHow does the offender intend to manage in the community? Members look at the risk management plan for details of where they plan to live, what kind of support they will receive from family and friends, and whether they will have a job.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eWhat is their relationship like with their Offender Manager? Will they be honest and open with them about any issues which arise once they are released?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the panel decides that an offender should be released, this is not the same as saying that he or she now poses no risk. However, it may be that their risk has been reduced to a level where it is now small enough to be effectively managed in the community, and the panel will only recommend release if they feel this is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"potential-outcomes-of-a-parole-hearing\"\u003ePotential Outcomes of a Parole Hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three different potential outcomes of a parole hearing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRelease - once the Parole Board has directed the release of a prisoner, it is up to the Ministry of Justice to make the arrangements.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOpen Conditions - the Parole Board can recommend that a prisoner moves to an open prison, however it is for the Ministry of Justice to make the final decision.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFurther Review (sometimes referred to as a knockback) - under current legislation, the prisoner will be eligible for a further review within two years. The date of the next review will be set by the Ministry of Justice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

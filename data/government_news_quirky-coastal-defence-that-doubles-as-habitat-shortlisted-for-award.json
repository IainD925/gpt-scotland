It puts a new twist on the classic method of using rock armour by using local supply chains for low-carbon concrete blocks. Each block comes in a variety of patterns and configurations and hardy enough to cope in a challenging breakwater environment. The unique designs on the blocks offer a foothold for coastal biodiversity like algae to cling to, each block becoming a mini habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Newlyn project was selected as one of 14 project finalists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet Googe of the Environment Agency said: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe and our partners Kier and Atkins are very pleased to see the work at Newlyn to investigate better protection with better habitats being shortlisted in a very competitive field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThe sight of these eco blocks has created a positive buzz in Newlyn and taken us to classrooms to share these lessons as well as host children’s art works around our compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"img\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64a3d931bb13dc000cb2e601/some-of-the-eco-blocks-in-place-and-showing-signs-of-habitat-grow.JPG\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the eco-blocks in place and showing signs of habitat growth\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a second round of judging, including a site visit by a panel of industry leaders, the winners will be announced at a gala ceremony in Bristol on Friday 10 November, hosted by Rob Bell, TV presenter and engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe public can also get involved by voting for the project they would like to see win the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ice.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/ice-near-you/uk/ice-south-west/awards/civil-engineering-awards\"\u003ePeople’s Choice Award\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda Housden, ICE South West Regional Director, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe People’s Choice Award is a great opportunity to promote civil engineering to the public and celebrate the hard work that civil engineers engage in to benefit the region’s communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eI’d encourage everyone to find out more about the outstanding projects on the shortlist and cast a vote for the scheme they think has had the greatest positive impact for local communities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe deadline for voting is 5pm on Tuesday 29 August 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFounded in 1818, the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) is a UK-based international organisation with more than 95,000 members, ranging from students to professionally qualified civil engineers.

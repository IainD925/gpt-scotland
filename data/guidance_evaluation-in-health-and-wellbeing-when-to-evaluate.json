It is important to recognise these instances so that limited resources can be saved and used elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvaluability assessment involves assessing the extent to which an intervention can be evaluated in a reliable and credible fashion (Davies, R. (2013). Planning Evaluability Assessments: A Synthesis of the Literature with Recommendations. Report of a Study Commissioned by the Department for International Development).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvaluability can be considered in 3 complementary ways:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein principle\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein practice\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein relation to utility\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first relates to the nature of the intervention design (for example, is the theory of change supported or plausible in this intervention) and focuses on whether it is possible to evaluate the intervention as has been described or implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second considers the availability of relevant data and systems needed to make that data available. A variety of more or less costly methods may be needed to collect reliable evaluation data. So evaluability depends on access to that data and the practicality and cost of collecting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe third aspect of evaluability is the potential usefulness of the evaluation (Davis, 2013). This is likely to involve the perspectives of relevant stakeholders and users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"prioritising-evaluations\"\u003ePrioritising evaluations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOgilvie and colleagues describe a process by which researchers and practitioners can prioritise which evaluations should be conducted. They suggest that whether an evaluation is worthwhile can be assessed by considering the following important questions, before making evaluation decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions should be considered, especially if funding is limited and choices need to be made to select only some interventions for evaluation. Evaluability checklists are available, and can provide a useful and systematic approach to ensuring all relevant issues are considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the stage of development or implementation of the intervention? Is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe intervention too early in its development to make evaluation meaningful\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere already enough evidence to support the implementation of the programme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAre the results of the evaluation likely to lead to change in policy or practice? Ask:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewho is the target population and are they in need\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewill the results have any bearing on policy questions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecould policy decisions rely on the results\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecould the results have implications for more than one sector (for example, education, transport, and health)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow widespread or large are the effects of an intervention likely to be? Is the intervention:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elikely to have a substantial effect on a large number of people\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eaddressing a risk factor for just a small subgroup which nonetheless has important adverse or knock-on effects\n  it contributing towards increasing or reducing health inequalities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCan the findings of the evaluation add to the existing body of evidence? Ask if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethis test is an established intervention in a novel way, different setting or a new group\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethis intervention will have effects on outcomes that have not been previously studied\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe mechanisms are underpinning intervention effects understood\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIs it practical to conduct a meaningful evaluation within the time and resources available? Can:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edata be collected and analysed at an appropriate time, or routinely available data used retrospectively\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany effects of the intervention be separated from other changes taking place\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"acknowledgements\"\u003eAcknowledgements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis work was partially funded by the School for Public Health Research, the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC) and by Public Health England.

It will also help you access details of sector-specific issues of which you should be aware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"export-regulations-for-biotechnology-and-pharmaceuticals-products\"\u003eExport regulations for biotechnology and pharmaceuticals products\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRegulations, charges or other restrictions may apply to biotechnology and pharmaceutical exports as they leave the UK and when they arrive at their destination country. It is important that you research both sides of the transaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports in the life sciences sector by accessing our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eonline trade tariff\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe above tool will enable you to classify your goods. Using standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that in general it is much simpler to trade with other EU countries than with countries outside the EU. This is because the goods are in free circulation. The EU is a single market and the UK is in a customs union, so you can trade most goods with other EU countries without restriction. However, biotechnology and pharmaceutical products are likely to be exceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"export-licensing-and-certification\"\u003eExport licensing and certification\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePharmaceutical products tend to be restricted and stringent licensing requirements are applied. An export licence is required in order to export specified goods with military uses. You may require an export licence for dual-use goods which have a potential military use, eg components of chemical and biological weapons. Biotechnologists, for example, must comply with the export control regulations co-ordinated by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (\u003cabbr title=\"Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\"\u003eBIS\u003c/abbr\u003e) Export Control Organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/export-control-organisation\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRead about the Export Control Organisation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor information on export licences, read the guide on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-and-import-licences-for-controlled-goods-and-trading-with-certain-countries\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eimport and export licences\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"exporting-goods-for-processing\"\u003eExporting goods for processing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be able to obtain relief from customs duties when you reimport European Community (\u003cabbr title=\"European Community\"\u003eEC\u003c/abbr\u003e) goods that have previously been exported from the \u003cabbr title=\"European Community\"\u003eEC\u003c/abbr\u003e for processing.

There is also the Cladding Safety Scheme which opened in July 2023 to fund the remediation or mitigation of life-safety fire risks in buildings where unsafe cladding is present. The scheme is being delivered by Homes England and is open for applications for buildings between 11-18 metres in London and buildings over 11m in the rest of England, where a responsible developer cannot be identified, traced, or held responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e22. Industry negotiations have also delivered a wide-ranging industry agreement with 55 of the largest developers signing legally binding contracts committing to remediate life-critical fire safety defects in residential buildings they had a role in developing in England over the 30 years prior to 5 April 2022. This total includes all Top 10 housebuilders. Between them, the developers who signed the contract account for almost half of new homes. By signing the contract, they have committed to remediate or pay to remediate 1,345 buildings above 11 metres which are identified as needing remediation works in England. Together, they have taken responsibility to carry out or pay for an estimated £2.7 billion of works to make those buildings safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

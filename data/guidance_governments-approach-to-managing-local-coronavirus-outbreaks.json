And in a way that avoids a new epidemic, minimises lives lost and maximises health, economic and social outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are now able to better identify outbreaks at an early stage and take steps to ensure appropriate local intervention. Local outbreaks are identified and managed through continuous monitoring of the available data and different approaches are required according to local circumstances. See \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-covid-19-surveillance-reports\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eregular data on COVID-19 indicators in different parts of the country\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"areas-with-local-restrictions\"\u003eAreas with local restrictions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee Local restrictions: areas with an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) for a list of areas with additional local restrictions, including information for local authorities, residents and workers about what to do and how to manage the outbreak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of England should follow the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on staying alert and social distancing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities may also have put in place local restrictions. You can find out more about this on your local authority’s website. \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFind your local council\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"our-approach-to-managing-local-outbreaks\"\u003eOur approach to managing local outbreaks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur approach to managing local outbreaks is in 5 parts, which can be scaled up rapidly as needed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eMonitoring: the Joint Biosecurity Centre (\u003cabbr title=\"Joint Biosecurity Centre\"\u003eJBC\u003c/abbr\u003e) and Public Health England (\u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e) examine data on the spread of the disease and people’s behaviour across the country on a daily basis. Local data is shared with directors of public health in local authorities so they too can monitor what is happening in their area. It is also available to the public on our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ecoronavirus dashboard\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eEngagement and communication: if monitoring suggests that there are problems at a local level, the \u003cabbr title=\"Joint Biosecurity Centre\"\u003eJBC\u003c/abbr\u003e and \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e will engage the relevant local authority to generate a joint understanding of the problem and develop solutions. Effective communication with the local community at an early stage is crucial to avoiding the need for tougher measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eTesting: we have substantial testing capacity at a national level which can be targeted at local areas in order to get a grip on emerging outbreaks. Mass testing at a local level, combined with contract tracing through NHS Test and Trace, can control the virus and thus avoid stricter measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eLocal restrictions: if the virus continues to spread, either a local authority or the government can restrict activities at particular locations and close individual premises.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eNational intervention: if the previous measures have not proven to be enough, the government can put in place further measures. This might involve shutting businesses venues that would otherwise be allowed to open, closing schools, and asking people to stay at home or restrict their movement. These measures will be carefully tailored to the specific circumstances of each outbreak and reviewed at least every 2 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCOVID-19 contain framework\u003c/a\u003e sets out how local authorities and national government will work together to manage local outbreaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have provided local authorities with \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-under-coronavirus-regulations\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003enew powers\u003c/a\u003e to act more quickly, where speed is central to preventing outbreaks from spreading more widely.

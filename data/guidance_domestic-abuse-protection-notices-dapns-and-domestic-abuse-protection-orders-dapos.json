These orders are currently being piloted in certain areas only – check \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/domestic-abuse-protection-notices-dapns-and-domestic-abuse-protection-orders-dapos#where-can-i-apply-for-a-dapo\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWhere can I apply for a DAPO\u003c/a\u003e to see if this is relevant to you, and what you can do if you live elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a victim of domestic abuse or know somebody else who is, you may be able to apply for a DAPO. If you are a victim, it may be that a DAPO is applied for or made on your behalf, for example by the police, by a relative, a social worker or by the court during an ongoing court case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-code-of-practice-for-victims-of-crime/code-of-practice-for-victims-of-crime-in-england-and-wales-victims-code\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eVictims’ Code\u003c/a\u003e explains your rights as a victim of crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-domestic-abuse\"\u003eWhat is domestic abuse?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Domestic Abuse Act 2021 says that abusive behaviour can consist of any of the following: physical or sexual abuse; violent or threatening behaviour; controlling or coercive behaviour; economic abuse; psychological, emotional, or other abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-domestic-abuse-protection-notice-dapn\"\u003eWhat is a Domestic Abuse Protection Notice (DAPN)?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA DAPN is issued by the police to a perpetrator to provide immediate protection to victims of all forms of domestic abuse. A DAPN can be issued where the police officer considers there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person has been abusive towards another person who is aged 16 or over. The perpetrator must be aged 18 or over. The victim and the perpetrator must also be personally connected – for example, they are, or have been married or civil partners, are or were in a relationship or are related. DAPN contains specific instructions that the perpetrator must follow, such as staying away from a victim’s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe police will consider whether a DAPN is necessary to protect the victim from further domestic abuse or the risk of domestic abuse.  If the police issue a DAPN, they will then also apply for a Domestic Abuse Protection Order (DAPO). A DAPO application will usually be heard by the magistrates’ court within 48 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA DAPN is legally binding, and failure to follow its conditions could result in the perpetrator being arrested and brought before a magistrates’ court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-domestic-abuse-protection-order-dapo\"\u003eWhat is a Domestic Abuse Protection Order (DAPO)?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA DAPO can be made by the court to protect victims from all forms of domestic abuse, including non-physical abuse and controlling or coercive behaviour. A DAPO may be made by a court during ongoing criminal, family, or civil proceedings. Applications can also be made by the police, by a victim themselves or by someone who is not directly involved, known as a ‘third party’. A third party could include a family member, a friend, or a social worker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDAPOs are protective orders and can be used to impose restrictions and conditions on a perpetrator of domestic abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA prohibition is a rule that prevents someone from doing something. For example, this could include stopping a perpetrator from coming within a specified distance of a victim’s home and/or any specified premises, such as a workplace.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA DAPO will always include mandatory notification requirements. This means that a perpetrator subject to a DAPO must tell the police their name and address and tell the police of any changes to these. The perpetrator subject to a DAPO is required to first tell the police their name and address within 3 days of a DAPO being made, and after that, within 3 days of any changes to these.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe court may decide to impose electronic monitoring (known as ‘tagging’) on a perpetrator to monitor whether they are following certain rules of the DAPO, for example those that stop a perpetrator from coming within a specified distance of the victim’s home.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe court may also decide to impose a positive requirement that calls for the perpetrator to take positive action, such as attending a behaviour change programme.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-long-does-a-dapo-last\"\u003eHow long does a DAPO last?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA DAPO has no minimum or maximum duration. The court will consider how long the DAPO needs to last to protect a victim from abuse or the risk of abuse and will specify the duration of the order when it makes a DAPO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-if-the-conditions-of-the-dapo-are-not-followed\"\u003eWhat happens if the conditions of the DAPO are not followed?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA DAPO is legally binding and breaking any of its rules is known as a breach. Breach of a DAPO is a criminal offence and should always be reported. If you are aware that any of the conditions or rules of a DAPO have been broken, you should contact the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a breach of a DAPO is reported, the police will investigate it and work with the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether the case will be charged as a criminal offence. The police will keep you informed about how the case progresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a perpetrator breaches their electronic ‘tag’, for instance by entering an area that they are banned from, the police will receive an alert from the electronic monitoring provider by 10:00am the following day. The police will then decide what action to take. This action will not be immediate – if you are in danger, you should call 999.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you report a breach, the police will give you a crime reference number. Keep a note of this in case you need to follow up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-can-i-apply-for-a-dapo\"\u003eHow can I apply for a DAPO?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are various ways you can apply for or request a DAPO:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYou can report domestic abuse to the police and request that they issue a DAPN or apply for a DAPO on your behalf. The police will decide whether a DAPN is needed initially.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eYou can apply for a DAPO yourself in the family court. To do so, you will need to complete a DA1 court form. You can find the form and a list of the courts taking applications at: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-domestic-abuse-protection-order-in-a-family-court\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eApply for a domestic abuse protection order in a family court\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIf both you and the person you are seeking protection from are already involved in another family court case, you can also apply directly to that court, using the DA1 form. If you’re involved in civil action, find out \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-domestic-abuse-protection-order-in-a-county-court\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehow to apply in a county court\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIf there is a criminal case against the perpetrator for another offence that affected you, the court can also make a DAPO for your protection, regardless of whether the perpetrator has been convicted or acquitted for that offence.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA ‘third party’ can also apply for a DAPO on your behalf. A ‘third party’ is someone who is not directly involved in the abuse. For example, this could be a family member, a friend, or social worker. As well as reporting domestic abuse to the police, a third party can make an application to a piloting family court, so long as they have permission from the court. To do this, a third party will need to complete forms \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-domestic-abuse-protection-order-in-a-family-court-form-da1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDA1 (Application for a Domestic Abuse Protection Order)\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ask-for-permission-to-apply-for-a-domestic-abuse-protection-order-on-behalf-of-someone-else-form-da2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eDA2 (Application for leave to apply for a Domestic Abuse Protection Order)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can seek any requirement which may be considered necessary to protect you from domestic abuse or the risk of domestic abuse. The court will consider these requests when making a DAPO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"is-there-any-cost-associated-with-applying-for-a-dapo\"\u003eIs there any cost associated with applying for a DAPO?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no court fees for victims applying for a DAPO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"where-can-i-apply-for-a-dapo\"\u003eWhere can I apply for a DAPO?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 27 November 2024, DAPNs and DAPOs are piloted in certain areas only. The current piloting areas are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLondon boroughs of Croydon, Sutton, and Bromley\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGreater Manchester\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe British Transport Police are also able to apply for a DAPO\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDAPNs and DAPOs are only available if the perpetrator lives in a piloting area. This means that, if you are a victim of domestic abuse, a DAPO application can be made regardless of where you live, so long as the perpetrator lives in a piloting area. If you don’t know where the perpetrator lives, the court or the police will help to find out whether you are able to apply for a DAPO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t live in a piloting area, it is possible that you may have to travel to attend court hearings at the piloting family or county court. If this is the case, you can contact the court to request a remote hearing. These requests will be considered by the judge and granted on a case-by-case basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are unable to travel to a piloting court, you may wish to consider applying for a Non-Molestation Order at your nearest family court. You can also ask the police to help protect you – the police can apply for different orders outside of DAPO piloting areas.

In some circumstances, a DAPN will be given or a DAPO will be made without your consent if it is believed you are at risk of harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are already involved in another court case, the court may make a DAPO if the court decides it is necessary to protect you. The court can do this even if the case does not relate to domestic abuse. The court will consider your views before doing so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe law also allows the police to issue a DAPN or make a DAPO application to protect you. They will do this if they consider the perpetrator has been abusive towards you or you are at risk of abuse. The police have a duty to consider your views before proceeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the police apply for a DAPO on your behalf, they may ask you whether you would like to submit oral or written evidence to support their application. Any evidence submitted may be considered by the court at the hearing. If the police apply for a DAPO on your behalf, you cannot be compelled to attend the court hearing, unless you have submitted evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-happens-when-the-dapo-ends\"\u003eWhat happens when the DAPO ends?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a DAPO is coming to an end soon, and you’re concerned about your safety, you can contact the police or a domestic abuse support service. You or the police can apply to change (vary) the order to make it last for longer. If the order has already ended, you or the police can apply for a new order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-if-i-dont-agree-with-the-dapo-or-want-to-change-it\"\u003eWhat if I don’t agree with the DAPO or want to change it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can apply to the court that made the order to change it or to bring it to an end (known as discharge). Ask the court that made the DAPO how to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also appeal against a DAPO. Ask the court that made the DAPO how you can appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may want to get legal help or advice if you don’t agree with a DAPO or want to change it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"can-i-get-free-legal-advice\"\u003eCan I get free legal advice?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may wish to seek legal advice.

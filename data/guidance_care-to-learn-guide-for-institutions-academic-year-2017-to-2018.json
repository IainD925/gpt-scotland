It provides general information about the eligibility criteria and application process but does not offer advice for every situation. Stakeholders who need further or more detailed help should contact the Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) \u003ca href=\"mailto:C2L@studentbursarysupport.co.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eC2L@studentbursarysupport.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e who administer C2L on behalf of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe further information section provides useful telephone numbers; email and website addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-summary-of-care-to-learn-in-the-2017-to-2018-academic-year\"\u003eA summary of Care to Learn in the 2017 to 2018 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe intention of C2L is to help young parents (defined as those aged under 20) to continue in education after the birth of a child. It provides funding for childcare whilst the young parent is engaged in a study programme and is not able to provide care for their child.  C2L can also help with travel costs involved in taking the child to the childcare provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scheme provides up to a maximum amount of £160 per child per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child per week in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe young parent’s study programme must have some public funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L will only fund childcare provision that is registered with Ofsted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo get C2L, young parents, their education institution and their childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents must complete and submit a new application each academic year even if their study programme runs for more than one year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents should apply for C2L before the start of their study programme or as soon as possible after they start so their eligibility can be confirmed and payments can start quickly. It is important young parents know that payments can only be backdated to the start of their study programme if their application is received within 28 days of the start date. Payments for any applications received outside of this timeframe will begin from the Monday of the week the SBSS receive the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents can apply before their baby is born, but SBSS cannot assess their application until they provide all the child’s details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders should tell young parents about the availability of financial support for childcare through C2L to help them make more informed decisions about their options.

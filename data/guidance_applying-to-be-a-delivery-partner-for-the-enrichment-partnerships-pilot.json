Findings from that programme highlighted that enrichment offers would benefit from engaging young people in co-design, harnessing local provision and coordinating across clusters of schools. Enrichment offers should include a wide range of activities and address practical barriers (e.g. cost) and social barriers to participation (low confidence, negative perceptions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Enrichment Partnerships Pilot aims to improve the enrichment offer of up to 200 secondary schools in Education Investment Areas.

Alongside Project Gigabit, broadband suppliers are also extending gigabit-capable broadband coverage as part of the market-led commercial roll out. The government has set an overall coverage target of at least 85% of UK premises being able to access a gigabit-capable network by 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-gigabit-capable-broadband\"\u003eWhat is gigabit-capable broadband?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGigabit-capable broadband provides a download speed of at least 1 gigabit per second (or 1000 megabits per second). It is at least twenty times faster than the current average broadband speed in the UK will allow you to download a high definition film in less than 1 minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a range of different infrastructure types that can deliver broadband at this speed. These include: full-fibre, cable broadband, and fixed wireless access, with further information available in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-gigabit-delivery-plan-spring-update/project-gigabit-delivery-plan-spring-update#glossary\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eglossary\u003c/a\u003e section of BDUK website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-are-the-benefits-of-gigabit-capable-broadband\"\u003eWhat are the benefits of gigabit-capable broadband?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGigabit is considered a “future-proof” broadband speed, capable of providing enough capacity to support a household needs from using multiple devices simultaneously to supporting any future advances in technology. Faster more reliable broadband connectivity can also help support businesses to sell goods online, access cloud services and increase their productivity and turnover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe infrastructure that supplies gigabit-capable broadband can be much more reliable than older telecommunication networks. It is often delivered through fibre infrastructure - glass cables, encased in a thin layer of plastic, which transmit data via a light signal. These suffer five times fewer faults than old copper based networks. This delivers a better service for residents and businesses, and less time is spent on infrastructure repairs which can create local disruption like street works. It also maintains a consistently fast speed to a premises, unlike old copper lines which degrade your broadband speed the further away your home is from your local telephone exchange. Visit our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://projectgigabit.campaign.gov.uk/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eProject Gigabit website\u003c/a\u003e for the latest case studies and research on the benefits of gigabit-capable broadband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-will-my-area-be-covered-by-gigabit-capable-broadband\"\u003eHow will my area be covered by gigabit-capable broadband?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure across the UK will be delivered by broadband suppliers’ commercial rollout. However, there remain some areas of the country which will be too costly for a broadband provider to cover on a commercial basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a premises is within these types of areas, and is eligible for public subsidy, the government’s Project Gigabit has a number of interventions designed to provide gigabit-capable broadband:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eProject Gigabit Procurements\u003c/strong\u003e - The majority of premises that will be connected by Project Gigabit will be served by the Project Gigabit Procurements element of the Programme. These will involve local, regional, and cross-regional contracts with broadband suppliers to deliver gigabit-capable infrastructure to an agreed set of premises. We call these “intervention areas” - premises we understand do not have access to gigabit-capable speeds and will not be connected by the market-led commercial roll out in the next three years. Our procurements will launch in a phased way over the lifetime of Project Gigabit. BDUK’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/project-gigabit-quarterly-updates\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003equarterly updates\u003c/a\u003e provide the latest timetable for when these contracts will begin in your area. The sequence  of the pipeline prioritises those areas with a larger percentage of hard to reach homes and businesses that we expect will need government subsidy, and a higher percentage of premises which do not yet have access to superfast speeds\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGigabit Voucher Scheme\u003c/strong\u003e - Eligible residential and business not currently within Project Gigabit projects can apply for a UK Gigabit Voucher worth up to £4,500 for homes and businesses to help cover the costs of installing gigabit broadband. To see if your area is eligible visit the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gigabit-broadband-voucher-scheme-information\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eGigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme website\u003c/a\u003e. Some councils provide a local “top-up” voucher where the cost of connection is above the government’s voucher limit - an effective way to boost rollout - with some councils limiting their top-ups to premises with sub-30 Mbps broadband speeds to target the worst served areas\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGigaHubs\u003c/strong\u003e - We are working closely with councils and other public bodies to connect rural public sector buildings with gigabit-capable broadband in order to improve public services. These premises will act as “hubs” to bring gigabit-capable speeds into the heart of communities. This will incentivise other broadband suppliers to build off the newly installed network drawing surrounding premises into their build plans\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSuperfast Broadband Programme\u003c/strong\u003e - There remain legacy contracts under the government’s previous Superfast Broadband Programme that are still delivering to homes and businesses in the slowest-speed areas. These contracts are now mainly delivering full-fibre infrastructure, so over 90% of the premises delivered will have access to gigabit-capable broadband, while other contracts are being extended to deliver 100% gigabit build to some of the remaining sub-superfast premises\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-impact-will-the-process-of-installing-gigabit-capable-broadband-infrastructure-have-on-my-local-area\"\u003eWhat impact will the process of installing gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure have on my local area?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust like any infrastructure project, the installation of new broadband infrastructure may have some short-term disruptive impacts on a local neighbourhood. This includes deployment activity such as streetworks, for which the supplier will have outlined a planned completion date with the local council Highways team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBroadband suppliers use a range of installation techniques to deploy gigabit-capable infrastructure, for example via a public road or across private land. Suppliers will look to minimise disruption by using existing infrastructure such as ducts, overhead cables and poles, before considering the need to build new infrastructure. For more detailed information on the regulatory framework that oversees all installation of broadband infrastructure read our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/street-works-best-practice\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ebest practice for street works and highway works guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-about-those-premises-which-are-very-hard-to-reach-with-gigabit-capable-broadband\"\u003eWhat about those premises which are Very Hard to Reach with gigabit-capable broadband?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe costs of deploying gigabit-capable broadband rise exponentially as deployment extends to the most remote premises. A very small proportion of premises in the UK are considered Very Hard to Reach with gigabit-capable broadband technologies. This is due to factors like their isolated geographic locations, or the great distances between them and existing or planned telecommunications infrastructure. The government is progressing its work to explore the available solutions and technology types that can serve the Very Hard to Reach premises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-will-building-digital-uk-work-with-councils\"\u003eHow will Building Digital UK work with councils?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBDUK will work in collaboration with councils (via their digital connectivity programmes/leads) to connect eligible premises in your local area. Councils, whether unitary, county or district, have vital local levers that can help fast track broadband roll-out to rural communities. As an example, constructive working relationships with highways, broadband delivery or planning teams can help problem-solve delivery issues and ensure deployment isn’t held up.

It’s an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family, and was first isolated from patients during an epidemic in Tanzania in 1952.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe name chikungunya comes from a word in the Makonde language (one of the native languages in Tanzania) that means ‘that which bends up’, owing to the crippling pain in the joints caused by the virus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"symptoms\"\u003eSymptoms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChikungunya is characterised by a sudden onset of fever usually accompanied by joint pain (arthralgia). However, symptoms can range from mild or non-existent to severe. It can often be misdiagnosed as other viral illnesses such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dengue-fever-guidance-data-and-analysis\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003edengue fever\u003c/a\u003e in areas where these infections also occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther common symptoms of chikungunya include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emuscle pain\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eheadache\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003enausea\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efatigue\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erash\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe joint pain may be very debilitating, but usually ends within a few days or weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost patients make a full recovery. In some cases, joint pain and arthritis may persist for several months or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSerious complications are not common, but in older people the disease can contribute to the cause of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"transmission\"\u003eTransmission\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe chikungunya virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Aedes mosquito. Aedes aegypti is most commonly associated with the transmission of chikungunya in tropical and sub-tropical regions, but Aedes albopictus \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140722091854/http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/AsianTigerMosquito/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e(Asian tiger mosquito)\u003c/a\u003e has been associated with chikungunya transmission in more temperate regions, such as Italy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the mosquito feeds on the blood of a person infected with chikungunya, the virus enters and multiplies within the mosquito. After about 8 to 10 days, the mosquito can transmit the virus to another human, and can do this for the rest of its life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eChikungunya is not spread directly from person to person. If a person acquires chikungunya abroad and becomes ill on their return to the UK, they can’t pass the infection onto anyone else. The Aedes mosquito is not present in the UK, as the temperature is not consistently high enough for it to breed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take typically between 4 and 8 days for the first symptoms (usually fever and joint pain) to develop, but it can be shorter or longer in some people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"diagnosis\"\u003eDiagnosis\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSend the appropriate samples (with a full clinical and travel history) to Public Health England’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRare and imported pathogens laboratory (\u003cabbr title=\"Rare and imported pathogens laboratory\"\u003eRIPL\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cabbr title=\"Rare and imported pathogens laboratory\"\u003eRIPL\u003c/abbr\u003e is a specialist centre for advice and diagnosis for a wide range of unusual viral and bacterial infections including chikungunya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"treatment\"\u003eTreatment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no specific antiviral treatment for chikungunya.

Aedes mosquitoes bite during the day particularly around dawn and dusk (as opposed to mosquitoes that transmit malaria, which bite at night between dusk and dawn).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA good repellent containing N, N-diethylmetatoluamide (\u003cabbr title=\"N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide is a chemical used in many insect repellents\"\u003eDEET\u003c/abbr\u003e) must be used on exposed skin, together with light cover-up clothing.

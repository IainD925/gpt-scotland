The hepatitis B virus (\u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e) causes hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) and can also cause long term liver damage. It is vaccine preventable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe virus may be transmitted by contact with infected blood or body fluids contaminated by blood. The virus can be spread by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esharing or use of contaminated equipment during injecting drug use\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003evertical transmission (mother to baby) from an infectious mother to her unborn child\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esexual transmission\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehorizontal transmission (non-sexual contact between individuals, for example, household contact with an infected person)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ereceipt of infectious blood (via transfusion) or infectious blood products (for example clotting factors) in countries where screening of blood donors and donations is not performed.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eneedle stick or other sharps injuries (in particular those sustained by hospital personnel)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etattooing and body piercing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe incubation period from infection to the appearance of symptoms is around 12 weeks (range 40 to 160 days).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExposure to the hepatitis B virus causes an acute infection. Symptoms during acute infection can include tiredness, abdominal pain, a ‘flu-like illness’, nausea, vomiting,  joint pains, loss of appetite and jaundice. Children rarely develop acute symptomatic hepatitis B infection whereas up to a third of adults are symptomatic during this acute stage of infection. Individuals are infectious to others and mortality during the acute phase of infection is estimated to be less than 1%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the virus persists for greater than 6 months, the person has developed chronic (persistent) hepatitis B infection.  During chronic infection many people have no symptoms but will remain persistently infected and infectious to others. Chronic hepatitis B infection is more likely to develop if the infection is acquired in childhood. Up to 10% of adults will develop chronic hepatitis B infection if the infection is acquired in adulthood. Progressive chronic infection is characterised by ongoing liver disease. The long term complications of chronic hepatitis B infection include cirrhosis and primary liver cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLaboratory diagnosis of hepatitis B involves serological testing for several hepatitis B specific antigens and antibodies. Different serological “markers” or combination of markers are used to identify phases of \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e infection and to determine whether a patient has acute or chronic \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e infection, is immune to \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e as a result of prior infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection.

As acute hepatitis B  flares can occur during chronic persistent infection, \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e core avidity testing may be done to differentiate between an acute and chronic infection and a follow up sample should be obtained. \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e Colindale’s  Blood Borne Virus Unit provide reference laboratory services for hepatitis B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"management\"\u003eManagement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eViral hepatitis is a statutorily notifiable infectious disease, meaning the clinician suspecting the diagnosis is required to notify the proper officer of the local authority, usually the consultant in communicable disease control (\u003cabbr title=\"consultant in communicable disease control\"\u003eCCDC\u003c/abbr\u003e). The statute does not offer guidance on the definition of viral hepatitis that should be notified nor whether the notification applies to acute cases, but hepatitis b virus is indicated as a causative organism that is required to be notified to \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e under the health protection regulations 20108.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLaboratories that diagnose cases should report data to the health protection teams at \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e and in the case of acute hepatitis B this should be phoned through both in and out of hours.

Currently there is no indication to treat these people with antiviral drugs. People who develop persistent infection (including infants born to hepatitis infected mothers who have evidence of infection at 12 months old) need to be referred to a liver specialist. Treatment with drugs able to suppress the virus is likely to benefit the patient and decrease the likelihood of disease progression. Not all patients are suitable for treatment.\nFurther information is available in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://cks.nice.org.uk/hepatitis-b#azTab\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an individual (recipient) is thought to have been exposed to blood from another individual (donor), a \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e risk assessment should be done to determine whether post exposure prophylaxis is indicated. Where possible the \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e status of the donor should be obtained. Where a blood or sexual exposure has led to a perceived \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e risk, post exposure immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine should be considered. High risk exposures to a person known to be infectious for \u003cabbr title=\"hepatitis B virus\"\u003eHBV\u003c/abbr\u003e may warrant consideration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (pre-prepared antibodies against infection).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePost exposure prophylaxis recommendations are in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation-against-infectious-disease-the-green-book\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eImmunisation against infectious disease ‘The Green Book’\u003c/a\u003e, which are based on the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/archives/CDRreview/1992/cdrr0992.pdf\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ePHLS Hepatitis Sub-Committee guidance on post exposure prophylaxis\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdvice is also available from Health Protection Teams and through the Immunisation, Hepatitis and Blood Safety Department and the Virus Reference Department at \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e Colindale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInformation and guidance on \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/HepatitisB/GuidelinesHepatitisB/hepbInfoOccupational/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eprevention of hepatitis B in healthcare occupational settings\u003c/a\u003e is available.

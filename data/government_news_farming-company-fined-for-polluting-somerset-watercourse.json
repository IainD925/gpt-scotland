Officers attended and found dead fish – including brown trout and bullhead in the Hardington Brook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day they traced the discoloured water to a side stream flowing from the direction of Manor Farm, where they found a non-permitted discharge from the farm’s surface water drainage system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe discharge was heavily discoloured, and samples confirmed it would prove fatal to fish because of its concentration of ammonia and very high biological oxygen demand which limited the oxygen supply to the fish in Hardington Brook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eManor Farm is owned by the Radstock Cooperative Society, but operated on their behalf by Velcourt Ltd, of Orchard House, Phocle Green Business Park, Ross-on-Wye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe farm manager stopped the discharge and emptied the ditch.  But a follow up inspection by an Environment Officer on 14 September 2018 found polluting matter in the ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe inspection concluded the farm’s dirty drainage system still posed a ‘high potential pollution risk’ due to insufficient storage capacity and appropriate engineering. Consequently, farm run-off was able to enter the surface water ditch and subsequently the watercourse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Officer concluded the farm infrastructure was not adequately constructed in accordance with the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) (England) Regulations 2010 (SSAFO Regulations). Clean and dirty water systems were not adequately separated, and the slurry storage and dirty water drainage systems had not kept pace with the expansion of activities at Manor Farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eJo Masters for the Environment Agency said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eWe expect much better from such a large and experienced farming business, both for the environment and the local community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eRegulations are in place to protect the environment and our communities and by not keeping up with the regulations this company has put the environment at risk of harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince the incident there has been considerable investment in the farm’s infrastructure and Velcourt has also reviewed arrangements at the other farms it manages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"charge\"\u003eCharge:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn or before 1 August 2018, at Manor Farm, Hardington, Velcourt Ltd caused a water discharge activity not under or to the extent authorised by an environmental permit, namely the discharge of poisonous noxious or polluting matter into a tributary of the Hardington Brook, Somerset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"notes-to-editors\"\u003eNotes to editors\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"radstock-cooperative-society\"\u003eRadstock Cooperative Society\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2020 the Environment Agency accepted an Enforcement Undertaking (EU) from Radstock Cooperative Society in relation to their responsibilities in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Society, which owns Manor Farm, has made a payment of £10,000 to the environmental charity Westcountry River Trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-an-enforcement-undertaking\"\u003eWhat is an Enforcement Undertaking?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn Enforcement Undertaking is a Civil Sanction available to the Environment Agency (EA) as an alternative sanction to prosecution or monetary penalty for dealing with certain environmental offences. It is a legally binding voluntary agreement proposed by a business (or an individual) when the EA has reasonable grounds to suspect that an environmental offence has occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnforcement Undertakings for environmental offences were introduced under the Environmental Civil Sanctions (England) Order 2010 and the Environmental Civil Sanctions (Miscellaneous Amendments) (England) Regulations 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccepting an Enforcement Undertaking is always at the discretion of the EA but if accepted enables firms and individuals who have damaged the environment or operated outside of legislative requirements to offer to complete actions which will address the cause and effect of their offending, including making a payment to a suitable environmental project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEUs can be offered for offences including polluting rivers, breaching permit conditions designed to protect communities, or not registering and follow recycling/recovery obligations. The Environment Agency then carefully considers whether the actions offered by the offender are acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-use-enforcement-undertakings\"\u003eWhy use Enforcement Undertakings?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eBusinesses will voluntarily secure compliance now and in the future, without attracting a criminal record\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe environment, local community and those directly affected by the offending can benefit through actions being offered in an EU\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThey allow the EA to deal with the less intentional and polluting offending in a more proportionate way than prosecution through the criminal courts\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Environment Agency reserves the right to prosecute, where offenders do not follow the terms of an Enforcement Undertaking offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

We encourage guests and sponsors to discuss arrangements and the length of absence in advance of the guest’s departure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere guests will be away for an extended period, sponsors may wish to ask the guest to leave their belongings tidily and in a way that would allow the sponsor to use the room in their absence. Sponsors may also wish to ask the guests to confirm the details of their intended date of return. Where possible, guests should confirm arrangements for their date of return with their sponsor before they travel. We recognise this will not always be possible, in which case once they have been made guests should keep their sponsors updated on their plans to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a guest’s absence is under 4 weeks, sponsors are not required to notify their council. However, if a guest is absent on multiple occasions for fewer than 4 weeks, the sponsor should discuss the reasoning for this with their guest and engage with their local authority if they have any concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf guests are expected to be away for more than 4 weeks, or do not return within 4 weeks, sponsors should then follow the guidance in the section below (‘guests absent from sponsor accommodation for a continuous period exceeding 4 weeks’).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf sponsors decide not to continue with the sponsorship relationship they should contact their council as soon as possible, following the same process as when a sponsorship is not working out. Councils should pause ‘thank you’ payments and establish the sponsor’s interest in seeking a rematch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuests may need to arrange alternative accommodation or find a rematch if they are planning to return after their absence and their sponsor does not wish for them to return to the original matching relationship. If guests have found a rematch, councils will need to ratify the match and perform the necessary checks in line with existing \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rematching-and-the-councils-role-homes-for-ukraine\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003erematching guidance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guests-absent-from-sponsor-accommodation-for-a-continuous-period-exceeding-4-weeks\"\u003eGuests absent from sponsor accommodation for a continuous period exceeding 4 weeks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn situations where all guests plan to be absent from their sponsor’s accommodation for more than 4 weeks, or 4 weeks have passed and no guests have returned, the sponsor is required to notify their council of the absence. Councils should then pause the thank you payments to the sponsor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe responsibility rests with the sponsor to update their council of guest absences of over 4 weeks. Failure to do so could result in the relevant council making further investigations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"preparing-for-guest-absences-of-longer-than-4-weeks\"\u003ePreparing for guest absences of longer than 4 weeks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSponsors and guests should discuss arrangements in advance of the guests’ departure.

Councils retain flexibility to conduct checks if they deem it appropriate in order to restart these payments. When payments restart councils will follow the usual monthly in arrears ‘thank you’ payment cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere fraud is identified, councils should use their best endeavours to claw the money back applying their usual counter-fraud and debt collection practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuests should also contact their local council to find out whether their temporary absence may affect entitlement to any services they are currently receiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf guests go abroad, they can continue to get Universal Credit for up to 1 month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey must:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ebe eligible for Universal Credit when they are going abroad\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eremain eligible for it while they are abroad\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etell their work coach that they are going and let them know when they return\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-respond-when-a-guest-does-not-arrive-in-the-uk-when-expected\"\u003eHow to respond when a guest does not arrive in the UK when expected\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is no record that guest has arrived in the UK, you should assume they are most likely not in the country. As you cannot complete on Foundry the check that requires you to confirm the guest has arrived and is in the accommodation, the ‘thank you’ payment should not be paid and the tariff payment should not be claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-respond-when-a-guests-whereabouts-is-unknown-and-you-are-concerned-about-their-wellbeing\"\u003eHow to respond when a guests’ whereabouts is unknown, and you are concerned about their wellbeing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLocal authorities are not responsible for tracking the location of guests when their whereabouts is unknown unless the local authority is concerned about a child or an adult at risk due to care and support needs. It should be recognised that risk may arise by virtue of going missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are concerned that there are suspicious circumstances or the person may have suffered harm or will suffer harm, you must liaise with local police.

Any unaccompanied children who go missing should be immediately reported to the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are concerned about an adult at risk due to care or support needs, you should additionally liaise with your adult social care teams who will assess whether you have a responsibility under the Care Act 2014.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe local authority where the person is located should consider whether they have any statutory safeguarding responsibility. If you have reason to believe that a child or adult at risk is in your locality, for example, because the original sponsor resides there or you are receiving tariff payment in respect of the guest, you should liaise with your child or adult protection teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Taskforce may have useful relevant information relating to the guest. This might include date and port of arrival, the make-up of the household, and links with other local authority areas. If further information on the guest would be helpful to you to establish whether a statutory safeguarding duty might arise, please raise a JIRA ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"claiming-a-tariff-payment-when-a-guests-whereabouts-is-unknown\"\u003eClaiming a tariff payment when a guests’ whereabouts is unknown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA tariff payment should only be claimed where the s.151 Officer is assured that the guest is ordinarily resident in your local authority area. If a guest does not arrive in your area, you should not claim the payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere guests have crossed a local authority or devolved administration boundary because of a ratified rematch during their first year, we will fund the first local authority for the number of months that the guest resided in your area and fund the second local authority for the number of months the guest resided there. Local authorities should count the number of full calendar months a guest was in sponsorship in their area. If a guest was in the local authority for partial months, the local authority should claim for an additional month if the additional days total 16 or more.  This funding will be apportioned at reconciliation time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"thank-you-payment\"\u003eThank you payment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe thank you payment only becomes payable to those lead sponsors where it is confirmed that the guest has arrived, and the sponsor has passed the necessary property and safeguarding checks. All checks within the CMS must be completed before the council begins the process of issuing the sponsor payment. If a guest leaves whilst in sponsorship, the sponsor is eligible for payment for more than half a month of hosting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"if-a-guest-intends-to-leave-their-child\"\u003eIf a guest intends to leave their child\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere parents/legal guardians have applied through the main Homes for Ukraine scheme they should travel and stay with their children. Once in the UK, guests should not leave their child in the care of a sponsor (or an accompanying adult relative) for a period of 28 days or more. Guests should also not leave their child in the care of a sponsor (or an accompanying relative) for shorter periods on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf exceptional circumstances mean that the parent(s)/legal must leave their child in the care of a sponsor, guidance is clear that they should agree this with the sponsor and inform the council in advance so they can carry out additional sponsor suitability checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere councils are notified that a child will be or is already in the UK without their parent/guardian and outside the Homes for Ukraine eligible minors scheme you should:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eflag the newly identified unaccompanied minor on Foundry\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esecure parental or legal guardian consent for the sponsorship arrangements\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecarry out the safeguarding and sponsorship suitability checks required by the eligible minors scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003econfirm that the sponsor understands their role\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecarry out regular welfare checks on the sponsor and child to ensure the ongoing suitability of the sponsorship arrangements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis applies in all instances where it is known or intended that the child will be without their parent(s)/legal guardian in the care of a sponsor for a period of 28 days or longer, or when the parent(s)/legal guardian intends to leave the child in the care of a sponsor for shorter periods on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

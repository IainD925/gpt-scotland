It is an essential duty for trustees to take reasonable steps to safeguard beneficiaries and to protect them from abuse. An incident of abuse or mistreatment can include neglect. Trustees should also, where appropriate, promote the well-being and welfare of the charity beneficiaries. Additionally, trustees must take reasonable steps to protect staff, volunteers and those connected with the activities of the charity, from harm. A charity should be a safe and trusted environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find out more about safeguarding in charities by reading:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-duties-for-charity-trustees\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSafeguarding and protecting people for charities and trustees\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategy-for-dealing-with-safeguarding-issues-in-charities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCharity Commission strategy for dealing with safeguarding issues\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/services-and-resources/research-and-resources/2017/are-they-safe/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eNSPCC guidance on safeguarding children and young people\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"criminal-record-checks\"\u003eCriminal record checks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are legal restrictions under safeguarding legislation on who can be involved in working with children and adults at risk.

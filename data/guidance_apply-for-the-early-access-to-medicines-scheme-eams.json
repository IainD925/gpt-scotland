A \u003cabbr title=\"promising innovative medicine\"\u003ePIM\u003c/abbr\u003e designation is a prerequisite to enter the \u003cabbr title=\"earlier access to medicines scheme\"\u003eEAMS\u003c/abbr\u003e SO step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"when-to-apply-for-a-pim-designation\"\u003eWhen to apply for a \u003cabbr title=\"promising innovative medicine\"\u003ePIM\u003c/abbr\u003e Designation\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplicants are encouraged to apply when data from early stages in a clinical development programme indicate that the medicinal product fulfils the designation criteria, namely the product is likely to demonstrate significant benefit for patients in life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions.  This is because early regulatory and other stakeholder engagement is generally recommended to maximise the benefits within the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplicants may also apply towards the end of their clinical development programme and could consider applying for a \u003cabbr title=\"promising innovative medicine\"\u003ePIM\u003c/abbr\u003e designation and the \u003cabbr title=\"earlier access to medicines scheme\"\u003eEAMS\u003c/abbr\u003e SO pre-submission meeting (PSM) simultaneously – see later guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-pim-designation-criteria\"\u003eThe \u003cabbr title=\"promising innovative medicine\"\u003ePIM\u003c/abbr\u003e designation criteria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll three criteria, which must be fulfilled in order to gain a \u003cabbr title=\"promising innovative medicine\"\u003ePIM\u003c/abbr\u003e designation, are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"criterion-1-there-is-a-life-threatening-or-seriously-debilitating-condition-and-a-high-unmet-need\"\u003eCriterion 1: There is a life threatening or seriously debilitating condition and a high unmet need\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe severity of the disease should be justified based on objective and quantifiable medical or epidemiologic information, in terms of mortality and morbidity, with special emphasis on patient quality of life. For high unmet need, the Applicant should consider if there is no method of treatment, diagnosis or prevention available in the UK for the condition, or if methods already in use in the UK have serious limitations. From a regulatory perspective, methods ‘already in use’ include medicinal products that have a GB or UK marketing authorisation as well as standard of care and non-pharmacological therapies. The health technology assessment, commissioning or supply status of a product is not taken into account by the \u003cabbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\"\u003eMHRA\u003c/abbr\u003e. A critical review of the methods already in use for treatment, diagnosis or prevention in the UK should be provided, including an evaluation of the performance of these methods based on quantifiable data (e.g. data on survival, disease progression/relapses, or patient-reported outcomes). The Applicant should provide a justification for why methods already in use are not adequate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"criterion-2-the-medicinal-product-is-likely-to-offer-a-major-advantage-over-methods-of-preventing-diagnosing-or-treating-the-condition-already-in-use-in-the-united-kingdom\"\u003eCriterion 2: The medicinal product is likely to offer a major advantage over methods of preventing, diagnosing or treating the condition already in use in the United Kingdom.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Applicant should submit preliminary evidence, based on clinical data, indicating that the advantage and magnitude of effect claimed for the product is predicted to be of significant relevance to the patients and will address their unmet need. The major advantage could be improved efficacy, or similar efficacy but better overall tolerability, compared to methods already in use. A well-argued evaluation of the likelihood of achievement of the product’s claims should be provided, based on the totality of information available at the time of designation. This should include direct or indirect comparison to methods already in use.  From a regulatory perspective, methods ‘already in use’ include medicinal products that have a GB or UK marketing authorisation as well as standard of care and non-pharmacological therapies.

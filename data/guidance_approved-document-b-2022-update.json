This follows research carried out by the government and evidence heard at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry on the serious fire safety risks associated with this material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther changes to the regulations being put forward will:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eInclude elements of solar shading devices within the scope of the ban.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAmend the list of materials exempted from the ban to include fibre optic cables, and water proofing and insulation materials in the external wall, below and up to 300mm from ground level.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUpdate the requirement of the ban to refer to the latest version of the British Standard classification for materials used on high-rise residential buildings.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTemporarily exempt cavity trays.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAmend the requirements for material change of use in buildings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"updates-to-approved-document-b\"\u003eUpdates to Approved Document B\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government has also published an update to \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eApproved Document B\u003c/a\u003e to introduce new rules for external walls and balconies for new blocks of flats between 11 metres and 18 metres in height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis new statutory guidance sets clearer, stronger standards which will set limits on the combustibility of materials used in the external walls of buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will mean that lower risk developments between 11-18m meet necessary safety standards, while allowing designers and developers flexibility to use environmentally friendly materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new guidance balances the need to allow a degree of flexibility for lower risk medium-rise buildings so as not to preclude the use of environmentally friendly materials, such as structural timber, where they are used as part of a robust system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese latest changes to Approved Document B also build on the changes already introduced to improve building safety, including the provision for sprinklers in all new blocks of flats over 11 metres in height introduced in 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"grenfell-tower-inquiry-recommendation-implementation\"\u003eGrenfell Tower Inquiry recommendation implementation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe update also introduces provisions, in line with Grenfell Tower Inquiry Phase 1 recommendations, to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIntroduce Secure Information Boxes for new buildings over 11 metres in height.

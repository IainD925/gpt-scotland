Depending on individual circumstances, a licence applicant may also require a driving assessment and/or appraisal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"driving-during-medical-enquiries\"\u003eDriving during medical enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe time taken to obtain all necessary reports can be lengthy but a licence holder may retain entitlement to drive under Section 88 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. However, a driver whose last licence was revoked or refused because of a medical condition or is a high risk offender re-applying after a drink/drive disqualification from 1 June 2013 would not, however, be eligible to drive until they are issued with a new licence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver may be covered to drive, but this carries implications for road safety in that the licence holder may continue to drive with a medical condition that, on completion of DVLA’s enquiries, may ultimately result in licence withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is for the patient to assure themselves that they are fit to drive. Medical professionals who are asked for an opinion about a patient’s fitness to drive in these circumstances should explain the likely outcome by reference to this guide. The final decision in relation to driver licensing will, however, rest with DVLA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy reference to DVLA’s guidance, the doctor in charge of an individual’s care should be able to advise the driver whether or not it is safe for them to continue to drive during this period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePatients must be reminded that if they choose to ignore medical advice to stop driving this may affect the validity of their motor insurance cover. Doctors are advised to formally and clearly document the advice given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDVLA is solely reliant on doctors and other healthcare professionals for the provision of medical information. To make timely licensing decisions that impact on the safety of the individual and the public, DVLA needs information to be provided as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen DVLA holds all relevant information, a decision can then be made as to whether or not the driver or applicant satisfies the national medical guidelines and the requirements of the law. A licence is accordingly issued or refused/revoked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"outcome-of-medical-enquiries\"\u003eOutcome of medical enquiries\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDVLA does not routinely tell doctors of the outcome of a medical enquiry. Drivers are always informed of the outcome, either by being issued a licence or by notification of a refusal or revocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor cases in which the driver may not have the insight and/or memory function to abide by the refusal or revocation of their licence – for example, in cognitive impairment, dementia or a mental health condition – DVLA may, in exceptional circumstances, send a decision letter to the GP in line with prevailing legislation and GMC guidance on disclosures in the public interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a notification is received from a doctor in accordance with the GMC guidelines, unless relevant to one of these conditions affecting mental capacity, DVLA will send an acknowledgement letter only to the GP, to confirm receipt of the original notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"medical-notification-form-for-use-by-healthcare-professionals\"\u003eMedical notification form for use by healthcare professionals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-notification-fitness-to-drive\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003emedical notification form\u003c/a\u003e for use when patients cannot or will not notify DVLA themselves is available, for use by healthcare professionals only, on GOV.UK.

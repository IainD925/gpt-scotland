This fund will deliver bursaries for approximately 7,500 young people aged 11-18 and up to age 25 for young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) who are experiencing hardship or are otherwise vulnerable, and are therefore underrepresented in the sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the biggest concerns for young people are their mental health and their desire to have something to do in their local area. Whilst the outdoor sector provides worthwhile opportunities for young people, there are barriers to attendance which disproportionately affect certain groups of young people. Attendance can be hindered by the cost of activities and by their physical accessibility. Increasing costs of living are impacting parents and carers with 20% reporting they are unable to afford after school clubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOutdoor learning has been shown to increase young people’s attainment in schools and their attitudes towards learning. As such, attending outdoor youth services could reduce the risk of negative future outcomes for young people, all of which require more costly intervention later on (for example, mental health issues, becoming NEET, and serious youth violence).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fund-objectives\"\u003eFund objectives:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eObjectives of this fund to be achieved by March 2024 are:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003col class=\"steps\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvide bursaries for up to 7,500 young people:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  • Bursaries will cover the cost of residentials and/or transport costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  • Bursaries will be granted to groups who are underrepresented in the sector, such as young people living in poverty, young people with SEND, young carers and looked after young people, girls and young women, BAME (British, Asian and Minority Ethnic) young people, those with English as an Additional Language, those in the secure estate and those with poor academic attainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  • Young people must be 11-18, or up to 25 for young people with SEND.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvide outdoor experiences which can include activities focused on arts and/or sports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"delivery-partner-role\"\u003eDelivery partner role\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDCMS is seeking to appoint a single organisation or joint delivery body to support the delivery of the fund\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe value of this grant is approximately £1.5 million (inclusive of irreclaimable VAT) until March 2024.

They make a significant contribution to the economy, health and safety, and environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is responsible for accreditation and conformity assessment policy.

It increases trust in conformity assessment (see below) and helps products, processes, services, systems, persons and bodies be recognised across the UK and internationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccreditation ensures that those who carry out testing, certification and inspection are competent to do so. Accreditation is one of the key components of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-uks-national-quality-infrastructure\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUK’s National Quality Infrastructure\u003c/a\u003e (NQI), along with conformity assessment, standardisation, measurement, and market surveillance. Overall, the NQI makes a significant contribution to the economy, health and safety, and the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"accreditation-policy\"\u003eAccreditation policy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDBT leads on general accreditation policy across all departments. Individual government departments and agencies are responsible for the application of accreditation policy for their specific areas of responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the UK, the body appointed under the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/contents/made\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eAccreditation Regulations 2009\u003c/a\u003e as the sole national accreditation body (NAB) is the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). UKAS is the sole NAB for undertaking mandatory and voluntary accreditation in the UK. DBT will only recognise accreditation of UK based conformity assessment bodies that has been granted by UKAS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Regulation on Accreditation and Market Surveillance No 765/2008 (“RAMS”) became incorporated into GB law by the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and deficiencies were corrected by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 UK Statutory Instruments 2019 No. 696 (as amended). This is the legislative framework for accreditation in GB (referred to as GB RAMS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe regulations apply to accreditation used on a voluntary or compulsory basis in relation to conformity assessment. The following provisions relating to accreditation are in the legislation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erequires the NAB to be a not-for-profit organisation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erequires the NAB to evaluate the competence of a conformity assessment body when that body requests accreditation\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esets down requirements that the NAB must fulfil\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erequires the Government to monitor the NAB at regular intervals\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erequires the NAB to undergo regular evaluation by the body approved by the Secretary of State (peer evaluation)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Northern Ireland, Regulation (EC) No. 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance (as it applies in EU law, through the Northern Ireland Protocol) will continue to apply and be basis for accreditation policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"seek-accreditation-in-the-uk-with-ukas\"\u003eSeek accreditation in the UK with UKAS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccreditation is the recommended means of demonstrating a conformity assessment body’s competence. Where a CAB requests accreditation, it shall do so with UKAS as the sole NAB for the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the national accreditation body, UKAS is required to be compliant with UK legislation, engage with international accreditation forums and operate within the terms of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mou-between-dbt-and-ukas\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMemorandum of Understanding with DBT\u003c/a\u003e. UK businesses, government, and local authorities that need third party conformity assessment services should seek those services from conformity assessment bodies accredited by UKAS. Government only recognises UKAS accreditation of conformity assessment bodies operating in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ukas.com\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eUKAS website\u003c/a\u003e has more information on what accreditation is and the benefits of accreditation for both business and government, as well as how to apply for accreditation. It also has, for those seeking to employ an accredited conformity assessment body, a list of conformity assessment bodies accredited by UKAS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDBT sponsors and provides limited funding to UKAS to undertake public interest activities in representing the UK’s interests in the international accreditation infrastructure. Otherwise, UKAS is expected to be self-financing and operates as a not for profit organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"health-and-social-care-accreditation-policy\"\u003eHealth and social care: accreditation policy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccreditation underpins quality and confidence in health and social care provision to ensure consistency in the delivery of healthcare services to patients and commissioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn its role as the national accreditation body UKAS operates in the public interest and is committed to developing and delivering accreditation that provides assurance of services, including healthcare scientific and diagnostic services. Working with DHSC and other stakeholders, UKAS is committed to advancing the use of accreditation across health and social care sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn line with the government’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conformity-assessment-and-accreditation-policy-the-uks-quality-infrastructure\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eaccreditation policy\u003c/a\u003e and to ensure clarity about where accreditation can be used, the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) agreed a joint policy statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n  \u003ch3 id=\"government-policy-on-accreditation-in-health-and-social-care\"\u003eGovernment policy on accreditation in health and social care\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eThe following is the Department for Business and Trade, and the Department of Health and Social Care’s agreed policy on accreditation in health and social care:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eUKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation Service) is the sole government recognised national accreditation body \u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003esee footnote 1\u003c/a\u003e for organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eUKAS operates under a MoU with government that specifies the activities that UKAS is recognised to accredit, these include healthcare scientific and diagnostic services.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eUKAS’ role as the National Accreditation Body thus applies in the health and care sectors as in all others.

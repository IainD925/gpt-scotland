No-one has a right to a grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBVD will usually only consider making grants out of money that we have received. Grants will not usually be made of other types of assets themselves, or from the proceeds of sale of other types of assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"who-can-apply\"\u003eWho can apply\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBVD will usually only consider applications for discretionary grants from:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eformer shareholders (‘members’) as long as the company was solvent when it was dissolved\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eformer liquidators\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eformer administrators\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eformer company voluntary arrangement (CVA) supervisors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFormer directors of the company cannot apply for a discretionary grant unless they were also shareholders of the dissolved company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-to-apply\"\u003eWhen to apply\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBVD cannot deal with your application until they have received and banked the funds of the dissolved company from the bank or person holding the funds. If you are not sure whether BVD have the funds, please check with the bank or person holding the funds. BVD will not make enquiries for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-circumstances-in-which-a-grant-may-be-made-where-a-company-cannot-be-restored\"\u003eThe circumstances in which a grant may be made where a company cannot be restored\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a company cannot be restored to the Register, the policy is to make grants only where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003epaying the grant would alleviate hardship\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit would otherwise be unreasonable or unconscionable for the Crown to keep the assets\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethere is a compelling public interest in making the grant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach case will be decided on its facts. Your application must provide evidence to demonstrate that one or more of the criteria apply. A high standard of evidence is required to support your application. This is because you will be asking BVD to pay funds away from the Exchequer which would otherwise benefit the country as a whole. Therefore your own private interests will in most cases be unlikely to override the strong public interest in the taxpayer retaining funds that legally belong to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that the funds have become bona vacantia without you or your advisers understanding the operation of the law is not grounds for a grant. Nor is ignorance of an asset belonging to the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease make sure you include all the evidence you want BVD to consider in your application before you send it as usually a decision will be based only on what you provide on applying and it will be assumed you have set out all of the relevant facts. BVD’s role is not to guide you towards a successful grant application as they represent the interests of the Crown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-it-will-cost\"\u003eWhat it will cost\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf BVD make a discretionary grant, you will have to pay the BVD’s proper legal costs and disbursements for dealing with your application. These costs are usually £300. Costs and disbursements will always be deducted from any grant that is made, so if they hold less than £300, a grant cannot be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor grants over £750, BVD also keep 5% of the value of the grant after deducting costs. This is called a reservation. This is kept in case, in the future, the Treasury Solicitor has to pay creditors of the company money paid out as part of the discretionary grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Treasury may require BVD to keep some of the amount held as the “Crown’s Share”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"apply-for-a-discretionary-grant\"\u003eApply for a discretionary grant\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease check with your bank that BVD have the money or funds that you think they have.

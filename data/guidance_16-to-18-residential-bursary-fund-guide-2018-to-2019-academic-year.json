Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) have produced it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide is non-statutory. However, ESFA expects institutions to use it as the basis of their RBF policies and to be able to show they comply with it at any audit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"key-points\"\u003eKey points\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF is intended to support students who are attending the institution to take part in a designated specialism – mostly, but not exclusively, this is land-based provision.  ESFA expects that the majority of the students receiving RBF will be studying in the designated specialist subject area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny student to whom the institution awards RBF whilst participating in general FE provision that is widely available, for example, A levels or vocational qualifications, should be a genuine exception based on individual student circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF is designed to provide a contribution to an eligible student’s accommodation costs and ESFA expects the majority of an institution’s RBF allocation to be used for this purpose.  RBF can be used to help with travel costs between the student’s term time lodgings (if they are not on campus) and the institution where appropriate.  RBF cannot be used for travel costs for non-residential students, in other words, for home to institution travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF is part of the wider suite of student financial support funding provided by ESFA.  This includes other funding such as the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund and free meals in further education.  Like those schemes, RBF helps individual students overcome financial barriers to participation.  If a student leaves their study programme part way through the year, the institution must stop RBF (or any other student financial support funding) payments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the 2018 to 2019 academic year, RBF allocations will be paid to institutions in 2 parts: two thirds in August and one third in April. This is the same payment schedule as the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"residential-bursary-fund-a-summary\"\u003eResidential Bursary Fund: a summary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF provides financial help towards the costs of accommodation for students attending one of the designated institutions delivering specialist provision.  Specialist provision is not available locally and/or requires the student to attend at unsociable hours on a regular basis and consequently the student needs to live away from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF enables young people to gain a substantial qualification in a specialist subject that they would not be able to get at a non-specialist institution. RBF should not be used to enable a student to participate in additional activity, for example, to take part in a specific sport, whilst they are participating in general FE provision that is widely available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF provides a contribution towards residential costs.  Institutions should target the funding at students they assess face the most significant financial barriers to participation. RBF is not intended to provide support to all students on residentially delivered provision, or to necessarily cover the full costs for each student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF can be used for accommodation in private lodgings or accommodation that is owned or managed by the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions use RBF for travel costs for residential students living off campus (between term time lodgings and the institution), the amount they spend must not exceed 15% of their total RBF allocation. To make sure RBF maintains its primary focus on residential support, spend on travel is also capped at £25,000. This means that where 15% of the institution’s allocation would be greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum the institution can spend on travel costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can use up to 5% of their allocation for administrative costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"eligibility-criteria\"\u003eEligibility criteria\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible to receive RBF in the 2018 to 2019 academic year, students must be aged 16 or over but under 19 on 31 August 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged 19 or over are only eligible for RBF if they are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’) or have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"residency\"\u003eResidency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must meet the residency criteria in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eESFA funding regulations\u003c/a\u003e for post-16 provision in the 2018 to 2019 academic year.

Institutions must, however, ensure RBF support is targeted at those students facing the most significant financial barriers to participation.  They should assess the student’s actual need for help with residential costs before awarding RBF support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should take account of the young person’s household income when deciding how much RBF to award.  Household income must be verified by evidence, for example, an award notice showing receipt of benefits, a P60, Tax Credit Award Notice, evidence of self-employment income etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"eligible-education-provision\"\u003eEligible education provision\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF is designed to enable students to gain a substantial qualification in a specialist subject area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA expects the majority of students awarded RBF to be enrolled in a specialist subject area (this is mostly, but not exclusively, land-based provision).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny use of RBF to support students enrolled in general FE provision that is widely available must be by exception. RBF should not be awarded simply to enable a student to participate in additional activity, for example, to take part in a specific sport; or to enable a student to attend a particular institution when the qualification they are studying is widely available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung people on any paid education, training or apprenticeship programmes are not eligible for RBF support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"assessment-of-rbf\"\u003eAssessment of RBF\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions have discretion to decide which students receive RBF and how much RBF they are awarded.  They should manage the number and size of RBF awards they make to keep within their budget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should publish a statement setting out their RBF policy to help students understand the criteria against which they will be assessed. The statement should be published early enough for students to be able to use the information when deciding which post-16 institution to attend. The institution’s policy must be clear and available to students and to ESFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should take account of equalities legislation in their RBF policies.  This means they must not discriminate against their students based on their protected characteristics. Institutions are also subject to the public sector equality duty in section 149 (1) of the Equality Act 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions’ decision on whether a student is eligible for RBF should be based on their household income and their actual need for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents can receive benefits and/or other forms of financial support at the same time as RBF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere students’ accommodation is off campus, institutions may use RBF to help with the cost of travel from term time lodgings to site (up to a maximum of 15% of their allocation, capped at £25,000). The use of RBF for travel costs does not replace the statutory duty on local authorities to set out, in an annually published transport statement, the arrangements they will make to facilitate the participation in education or training of young people of sixth form age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"paying-rbf\"\u003ePaying RBF\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF payments for accommodation must be made directly to the student’s landlord.  The landlord may be the institution itself if they provide accommodation directly or a private landlord. No payments should be made directly to the student as these payments would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income related Benefits Regulations 2000).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-rbf-cannot-be-used-for\"\u003eWhat RBF cannot be used for\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should not use RBF for any purpose designed to give them a competitive advantage over other institutions.

They should not automatically continue with RBF payments without review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"funding-and-allocations\"\u003eFunding and allocations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF allocations for the 2018 to 2019 academic year have been generated using the methodology below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003efor institutions that spent their 2016 to 2017 allocation in full, or who spent within £15,000 of their allocation, 5% has been added to their 2017 to 2018 allocated amount to generate the allocation\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003efor institutions that underspent against their 2016 to 2017 allocation, their allocation is their 2016 to 2017 actual spend\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003efor institutions who received 5% growth in their 2017 to 2018 allocation but who underspent in 2016 to 2017, their allocation is the same as their 2017 to 2018 allocation\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe allocations methodology disregards any spend by institutions that is outside policy guidelines (inappropriate use of RBF for travel for non-resident students, for example). In the future, ESFA may also disregard spend by institutions where RBF is being used to support students on non-specialist provision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use up to 5% of their RBF allocation to cover administrative costs. The 5% should be taken from the allocation total; it is not an additional 5% on top of the total allocation.  Institutions should use the funding allocated to them for RBF solely to support eligible students with residential costs in line with RBF policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions identify that they will be unable to spend the majority of their RBF allocation, they should notify ESFA as soon as possible to arrange to repay the excess via our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/fillform.php?self=1\u0026amp;form_id=HR41uA2F8Dh\u0026amp;type=form\u0026amp;ShowMsg=1\u0026amp;form_name=Knowledge+centre+enquiry+form\u0026amp;noRegister=false\u0026amp;ret=%2Fmodule%2Fservices\u0026amp;noLoginPrompt=1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eonline enquiry form\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA will aim to distribute any returned funds to other RBF institutions that can make use of further funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are not permitted to transfer any funds from RBF to other student support schemes provided by ESFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF funding will be reconciled by ESFA at the end of the academic year.  Funds cannot be carried forward to future years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF allocations will be paid to institutions in 2 parts: two thirds in August and one third in April. This is an adjustment to the previous RBF payment schedule and brings the schedule into line with the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund and free meals in further education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may top up RBF from their own sources if they choose to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"individualised-learner-record-and-management-information-requirements\"\u003eIndividualised Learner Record and management information requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA reminds institutions of the importance of completing the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) to indicate the numbers of students getting residential support from RBF.

Institutions should ensure they have appropriate processes in place to record RBF applications and awards (including the number, value, purpose, whether awarded or not, and a brief justification for the decision).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure they can evidence their application process, how the student was assessed, how they made the decision to award the specific amount of RBF and the funds that they have issued for the student’s costs. Auditors will be looking for evidence that institutions have applied their RBF eligibility criteria correctly and used a consistent application and assessment process for all students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should retain copies of any documents the student has signed to give formal agreement to their conditions for payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHard or scanned copies of documentation should be retained for 6 years (records can be kept electronically).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should note that, following an audit, funding might be recovered where RBF payments are found not to have been made in accordance with this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA cannot guarantee to reimburse any overspends by institutions as this is dependent on funds becoming available for redistribution. Institutions are therefore advised not to overspend in the expectation that there will be a reallocation of funds later in the year. ESFA will not reimburse any overspend that is not within the scheme rules as set out in this guide and may take action to recover any RBF funds spent outside the scheme rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"institutions-responsibilities-in-managing-complaints-or-appeals\"\u003eInstitutions’ responsibilities in managing complaints or appeals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny student or parent who is unhappy with how an institution has handled their application for RBF should follow the institution’s own complaints procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should explain to students how they can complain or appeal about any decision relating to RBF support and/or the way in which their application for RBF support was handled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA does not have a role in the administration of RBF because this is the responsibility of individual institutions.  As such, ESFA does not usually get involved with complaints.  However, ESFA may get involved if there is an allegation that the RBF eligibility criteria or any content within this guide is being seriously disregarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should direct any queries about the allocation and administration of RBF to ESFA via our \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://form.education.gov.uk/fillform.php?self=1\u0026amp;form_id=HR41uA2F8Dh\u0026amp;type=form\u0026amp;ShowMsg=1\u0026amp;form_name=Knowledge+centre+enquiry+form\u0026amp;noRegister=false\u0026amp;ret=%2Fmodule%2Fservices\u0026amp;noLoginPrompt=1\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eonline enquiry form\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The college should seek agreement from the home local authority for a high needs placement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome high needs can be identified after enrolment. Colleges have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to use their best endeavours to meet the special educational needs of their students, including 14 and 15 year-olds. Where, despite the college having taken relevant and purposeful action to identify, assess and meet the needs of the student within its existing budget, the student is still not making expected progress, the college should draw the student to the local authority’s attention, and consider requesting the local authority to conduct an EHC needs assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"admission-appeals\"\u003eAdmission appeals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eColleges should use \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe School Admissions Code\u003c/a\u003e as a model for the expected practice for 14 to 16 provision with colleges.

An agreement must be in place between the two parties to that effect. If the local authority does not agree a placement (even where an institution may have assessed a student as requiring additional support or a student has been offered a place by that institution) and top-up funding for a student is not agreed to, these students cannot be counted as high needs for funding purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe principles which apply to post-16 high needs students apply equally to 14- to 16-year-olds directly enrolled in colleges.

The local authority would then provide top up funding (element 3) as appropriate from its high needs budget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an institution has filled the element 2 places it has been funded for, agreement needs to be reached with the local authority on the total level of support required. A local authority should not automatically be charged an extra £6,000 per head if it is agreed that the support package for additional students can be met at marginal, rather than full cost for the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFunding for students whose additional support costs are £6,000 or less and who are therefore not high needs students, should be met from the 14 to 16 in FE funding formula (described from paragraph 41 onwards) which provides a pot of disadvantage funding.

Underperformance may be identified through inspection or, when data becomes available, through the application of any national minimum or floor standards that relate to this cohort. Subject to the extent of that underperformance further recruitment of 14- to 16-year-olds may be suspended or ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first performance data relating to the 14 to 16 cohort was published in the Key Stage 4 2015 performance tables in January 2016 and shows the performance of the first 14 to 16 cohort who sat their Key Stage 4 examinations in the 2014 to 2015 academic year. The Key Stage 4 floor standard will be applied to those student outcomes. For reference, the current Key Stage 4 floor standard states that schools are below the floor, if fewer than 40% of students achieve five or more GCSEs at A* - C or equivalent including GCSEs (or iGCSEs) in both English and mathematics, and students make below average expected progress in English and mathematics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the 2015 to 2016 academic year, the floor standard will be based on Progress 8. If a college’s performance falls below this floor standard, then the college may come under scrutiny through inspection. The Progress 8 guidance published on GOV.UK provides specific details on how Progress 8 is calculated – this includes worked examples and diagrams.  For those colleges that trigger intervention for any of the reasons set out in this document, or in the Funding Agreement, the EFA (in the case of sixth-form colleges) and the Chief Executive of Skills Funding and/or the FE Commissioner (for general further education colleges) will act in accordance with the provisions set out in the relevant Funding Agreement and any applicable policy.

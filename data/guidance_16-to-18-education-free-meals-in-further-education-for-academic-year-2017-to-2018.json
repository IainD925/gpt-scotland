Any changes will be notified via an update to this guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback from institutions has indicated that there is some confusion about Working Tax Credit and whether children from families in receipt of it are eligible for free meals. Working Tax Credit is not a qualifying benefit for free meals, and a parent or student who is in receipt of only Working Tax Credits is not entitled to a free meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a parent or student is in receipt of one of the other qualifying benefits (with the exception of Child Tax Credit) as well as Working Tax Credit then they are eligible for free meals.  In other words, the other qualifying benefit takes precedence over Working Tax Credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should note that only Child Tax Credit currently has an income threshold (a maximum of £16,190 as shown above). The income threshold applies solely to Child Tax Credit and not to any of the other qualifying benefits. Institutions do not need to undertake any additional calculation relating to the amount of the award and/or the household income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must also satisfy the residency criteria set out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eFunding regulation guidance\u003c/a\u003e for the 2017 to 2018 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"verification-of-student-eligibility\"\u003eVerification of student eligibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for assessing applications for free meals.  The student, or their parent/guardian, must submit an application for free meals to the institution where they are enrolled. Some institutions may use a paper application form, others may use an on-line application form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the application, institutions must ask the student (or their parent/guardian) to provide evidence of the award of the qualifying benefits.  This might be an award notice or letter from the Department of Work and Pensions (\u003cabbr title=\"Department of Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e) or HMRC. Institutions may want to consider using a combined application form and process for free meals and the 16 to 19 Bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions will be aware that the Department for Education provides an electronic Eligibility Checking System (ECS) that enables local authorities to check free school meal (\u003cabbr title=\"Free School Meals\"\u003eFSM\u003c/abbr\u003e) eligibility on behalf of institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important that institutions and local authorities understand that the legal gateway (section 110 of the Education Act 2005) that enables the Department to obtain benefit information held by \u003cabbr title=\"Department of Work and Pensions\"\u003eDWP\u003c/abbr\u003e and HRMC for checking eligibility is limited to \u003cabbr title=\"Free School Meals\"\u003eFSM\u003c/abbr\u003e.  Information from the ECS cannot be used to check entitlement for free meals for post-16 students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"allocations-institutions\"\u003eAllocations to institutions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere possible, we have based 2017 to 2018 academic year free meals funding for further education institutions on their 2015 to 2016 academic year full year data and their funded student number for the 2017 to 2018 academic year.  We have used the number of students assessed as eligible for, and in receipt of, free meals in the 2015 to 2016 academic year as a percentage of the total number of students aged 16 to 19 reported in 2015 to 2016 full year data. This establishes the number of students we might reasonably expect to be eligible for free meals support in the 2017 to 2018 academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a secondary measure (if 2015 to 2016 full year academic year information is not available) we have used the equivalent end of 2014 to 2015 academic year data. Institutions should not assume we will follow this approach in future years and are strongly recommended to make data returns showing the number of students they have assessed as eligible for, and in receipt of, free meals on an ongoing basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have apportioned the number of fundable free meals students across the funding bands, using the same methodology as for mainstream allocations. Band 5, Band 4 and Band 1 FTEs are full-time students. Band 3 and Band 2 are part-time students. Two funding rates apply, one for full-time students and one for part-time students, equivalent to £2.41 per student per meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe may reconcile any 2017 to 2018 academic year allocations generated based on 0 free meals students in the end of 2016 to 2017 academic year data return where subsequent data returns show the institution has been allocated too much funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make an appropriate adjustment for double funding between free meals and the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund, we calculated each institution’s share (percentage) of the total number of students supported with free meals who informed the 2017 to 2018 free meals allocations. This percentage has been applied to the adjustment figure to calculate the amount to be subtracted from each institution’s discretionary bursary allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have built in protection levels so no institution experiences a reduction greater than the amount deducted in 2016 to 2017, or greater than 25% for their 16 to 19 Bursary Fund allocation. We have also ensured no institution has a 16 to 19 Bursary Fund allocation of less than £500.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurther information about the allocations methodology is set out in the 16 to 19 revenue funding statements (issued to institutions in February to March 2017).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"payments\"\u003ePayments\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe will pay free meals funding for the 2017 to 2018 academic year to institutions in 2 parts: approximately two-thirds in September 2017 and the remaining one third in April 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf any institution with a 2017 to 2018 free meals allocation does not have eligible students in the 2017 to 2018 academic year, they should contact us to return their allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use up to 5% of their single allocation (that is, free meals and the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund) for the administrative costs associated with verifying student eligibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"carrying-forward-funds\"\u003eCarrying forward funds\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Education and Skills Funding Agency\"\u003eESFA\u003c/abbr\u003e permits institutions to carry unspent funds over to the next academic year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must ensure that any unspent funds they carry forward continue to be used to support students. Funds that are carried forward cannot be added to general institution funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions given a single overall allocation for the 2016 to 2017 academic year that included funding for both free meals and discretionary bursary can carry forward funds from both schemes. The funding can be used for either free meals or discretionary bursary payments in the new academic year 2017 to 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must fully utilise any unspent funds for either discretionary bursary or free meals before using their new academic year allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe remind institutions that discretionary bursary and/or free meals funding cannot be carried forward for more than one year.

If a student has 2 days a week when they only attend from 9am to 10am, then the institution does not have to provide meals on those days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for encouraging and supporting students in making healthy food choices. Many caterers will be able to advise on suitable healthy options to offer students; further sources of information are provided in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-18-education-free-meals-in-further-education-for-academic-year-2017-to-2018#further-information\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efurther information\u003c/a\u003e section. Institutions should also offer hot food options where practical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should provide a meal free of charge to eligible students, or fund the free meal via an electronic credit or voucher that can be redeemed on-site or off-site where institutions have made arrangements with nearby food outlets. Electronic credits and vouchers must be worth a minimum value of £2.41.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an institution determines it is necessary to enhance the £2.41 free meals funding rate, in other words, to provide a meal with a greater value, from the single funding allocation or other sources, they have discretion to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must consider the value for money and reasonableness of an enhancement to the £2.41 rate and must be able to justify this, particularly if they choose to make a significant variation from this amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost of meals is sometimes included as part of the package of support for High Needs Students that is agreed with local authorities. In these instances, institutions should consider the issue of potential double funding for meals when assessing the need to support. This might be by deducting the appropriate amount of funding from the total costs of the package for those students who will be eligible for a free meal, enabling local authorities to utilise those funds elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of students will require a free meal at lunchtime to fit in with usual study/attendance patterns. However, institutions may exceptionally choose to make provision for a free meal at an alternative time, for example, a breakfast, depending on the study pattern of individual students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions must make free meals provision for students on days when they are off-site as part of their study programme, for instance attending a work placement or work experience. Wherever possible, institutions should provide the student with a voucher they can use at nearby food outlets or arrange with the work placement or work experience provider to provide a meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe expect that a meal, voucher or credit will be provided to eligible students.

Institutions should not enhance free meals funding to the detriment of other needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can give additional support to students eligible for a free meal from the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund, if the institution assesses they meet the criteria for a defined vulnerable group bursary or that they are facing significant financial barriers to participation and require support from the discretionary bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should ensure they consider the provision of a free meal, or the funding provided to the student for the free meal, when they assess their overall need for support, whether from the vulnerable or discretionary bursary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions can continue to use the discretionary bursary fund to provide meals to students who are not eligible for free meals if the absence of regular meals is providing a barrier to the student’s participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"communication-governance-and-monitoring\"\u003eCommunication, governance and monitoring\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"raising-awareness-of-free-meals\"\u003eRaising awareness of free meals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are responsible for ensuring students are aware of the eligibility criteria for free meals.

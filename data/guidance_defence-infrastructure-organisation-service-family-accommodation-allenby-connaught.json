This will be an estate of fewer, larger sites in the UK and overseas, appropriately located and making the best use of available resources while remaining fully capable of meeting military needs. Sites identified as having the potential for future development include Aldershot and Salisbury Plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe strategy for the army estate contains a concept of ‘super garrisons’ of which Salisbury Plain and Aldershot are 2, into which under any future organisational changes the army will seek to concentrate. Therefore while some units might relocate or be disbanded, they will be back-filled by units from other locations. The requirement for significant investment in the garrisons included within the project footprint is therefore robust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"pfi-and-background-to-the-project\"\u003e\n\u003cabbr title=\"Private Finance Initiative\"\u003ePFI\u003c/abbr\u003e and background to the project\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA Private Finance Initiative (\u003cabbr title=\"Private Finance Initiative\"\u003ePFI\u003c/abbr\u003e) project is one in which the private sector partner invests in assets and facilities from which it then provides services over the long term to the public sector. In the case of Allenby/Connaught the private sector will provide serviced accommodation and other support services. PFIs are widely used both within the MOD and across the wider public sector. MOD has PFIs for housing, simulators, vehicles, office accommodation and training establishments.

A reorganisation of force structures also resulted in some unit moves. Allenby/Connaught, was established to examine the best way of meeting these requirements.

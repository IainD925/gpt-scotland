Compulsory purchase can support the delivery of a range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects in the public interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/55/section/190\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eLevelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023\u003c/a\u003e, a power was introduced to allow for the assessment of compensation for the value of land taken by compulsory purchase to ignore values attributable to the prospect of planning permission (‘hope value’) in certain circumstances. This factsheet explains the power and how it can be used.

What is ‘hope value’ and how may it be removed from compensation for land taken?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompensation paid to a landowner where land is compulsorily purchased will reflect the value of the land if it had been sold on the open market (‘open market value’) by a willing seller at the valuation date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe assessment of compensation will ignore any increase or decrease in value caused by the scheme underlying the compulsory purchase (e.g. regeneration project, housing, new road, railway line etc) or the prospect of that scheme. This is known as the ‘no scheme principle’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen assessing the open market value of land compulsorily purchased, account may be taken of values attributable to the prospect of planning permission being granted on the land in the future. This is often referred to as “hope value”.

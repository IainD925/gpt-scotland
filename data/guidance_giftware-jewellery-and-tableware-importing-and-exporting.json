It is important that you research both sides of the transaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor further information, see the guides on exporting your goods from the EU to a third country and dispatching your goods within the EU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, you need to classify your goods. Using standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. You can use the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff) to classify your goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFind commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eonline UK Trade Tariff tool\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemember that in general it is much simpler to trade with other \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e countries than to countries outside the \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e. This is because the goods are in free circulation and have already cleared customs. The \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e is a single market and the UK is in a customs union so you can sell to other \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e countries without restriction (although some local charges may still apply).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"export-licensing-and-certification\"\u003eExport licensing and certification\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are specific regulations that exporters of jewellery need to comply with to protect their business. These relate to the Kimberley Process (for diamonds), money laundering, hallmarking, jewellery scams and packaging and labelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"kimberley-process-certificates\"\u003eKimberley Process Certificates\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kimberley Process has been designed to halt the trade of ‘conflict diamonds’ - diamonds used to finance violent conflict. This process applies only as a piece of legislation within the 123 countries who are signatories to the 2006 agreement but it is good practice for diamond exporters to adhere to the provisions described for any overseas sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor sales of half-cut diamonds, cut diamonds and finished jewellery containing diamonds, the framework of the Kimberley Process is extended through a self-regulatory system, which was introduced by the World Diamond Council and supported by key industry bodies such as the British Jewellers’ Association (\u003cabbr title=\"British Jewellers\u0027 Association\"\u003eBJA\u003c/abbr\u003e). Under this system, sellers of manufactured diamond jewellery or cut or polished diamonds give a warranty to confirm that their diamonds have originated from legitimate sources. Buyers of these products in virtually all key international markets are encouraged only to buy products covered by such warranty declarations. 99% of all traded diamonds now conform to Kimberley provisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"hallmarking\"\u003eHallmarking\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany countries require jewellery and other products made from or containing precious metals to be tested, hallmarked or otherwise stamped before retail sale. In some countries this can take place at the point of importation and can form part of the import process while other countries have agreements whereby UK hallmarks are accepted. Exporters should check this requirement prior to undertaking any overseas orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour destination country may have its own safety or quality standards that your products must satisfy - for instance, guarantees that children’s jewellery does not contain toxic metals. You must check local requirements prior to fulfilling orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"us-money-laundering-regulations\"\u003eUS money laundering regulations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUS businesses purchasing more than $50,000 worth of jewellery (including unfinished precious stones and metals) are required to have anti-money laundering procedures in place. This does not apply to foreign dealers who ship products into the US without conducting further business activity there, who just advertise locally or who attend a trade show without trading over this amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe requirements should not present serious problems to most responsible exporters but you can minimise any risk of delay or lost sales by preparing in advance. Ensure your contact information is clearly shown on all quotations, sales letters, proforma invoices, and provide your company registration and VAT numbers and US IRS number if applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCheck existing clients have all the information they need about your business so they can satisfy themselves and let them know if you comply with anti-money laundering legislation in other countries (such as the UK). You may also be asked to provide information about your products and their origin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the guide on how to label and package goods being shipped out of the UK\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"jewellery-sector-scams\"\u003eJewellery sector scams\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid fraud you should be cautious when selling to overseas customers via email or online auction sites. Be wary about requests for credit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnline fraudsters may build up trust by making advance-payment jewellery purchases over a number of years before requesting credit for a larger order and then disappearing with the goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"export-licences\"\u003eExport licences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn export licence is also required in order to export specified goods with military uses or so-called Dual-Use goods (which are products with both civilian and military use).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe list of goods requiring a licence does not include any giftware, jewellery and tableware products. However, you may require an export licence for goods with a potential military use, such as antique or replica firearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are interested in exporting to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), you should be aware that there is an arms embargo in place which includes ‘luxury goods’.

If a serious incident takes place within your charity, it is important that there is prompt, full and frank disclosure to the Commission. You need to report what happened and, importantly, let the Commission know how you are dealing with it, even if you have also reported it to the police, donors or another regulator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis guidance helps charity trustees identify serious incidents. It also explains how to report them and what to report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-a-serious-incident\"\u003eWhat is a serious incident?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA serious incident is an adverse event, whether actual or alleged, which results in or risks significant:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eharm to your charity’s beneficiaries, staff, volunteers or others who come into contact with your charity through its work (who are collectively referred to throughout this guidance as people who come into contact with your charity through its work)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eloss of your charity’s money or assets\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edamage to your charity’s property\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eharm to your charity’s work or reputation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of this guidance, “significant” means significant in the context of your charity, taking account of its staff, operations, finances and/or reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"who-should-report\"\u003eWho should report?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe responsibility for reporting serious incidents rests with the charity’s trustees. In practice, this may be delegated to someone else within the charity, such as an employee or the charity’s professional advisers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, all trustees bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring their charity makes a report, and does so in a timely manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you decide not to make a report about something serious that has happened in your charity and the Commission later becomes involved, you will need to be able to explain why you decided not to report it at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-must-you-tell-the-commission\"\u003eWhy must you tell the Commission?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-summary\"\u003eIn summary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the challenging nature of the work undertaken and the difficult context faced by many charities, the Commission understands that serious incidents will happen. When something serious happens, it is the Commission’s role to ensure that trustees comply with their legal duties and that the charity manages the incident responsibly. This means the Commission will be looking for assurance that the charity has taken steps to limit the immediate impact of the incident and, where possible, prevent it from happening again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost problems can be resolved by trustees themselves, in some cases with timely advice from professional advisers. Sometimes the Commission needs to use its powers to protect a charity. Taking action quickly will help protect your charity from further harm. Reporting also means the Commission can identify whether other charities might be affected, and can give better advice to all charities to help them protect themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-more-detail\"\u003eIn more detail\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReporting serious incidents to the Commission has three main purposes, which enable it to meet its statutory objectives and functions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe Commission needs to ensure trustees comply with their duties: By reporting a serious incident, you show that you have identified a risk to the charity that has materialised, and that the trustees are taking appropriate action to deal with it. This is very important because protecting the charity’s assets, reputation and people who come into contact with it through its work are essential trustee responsibilities. An incident is less likely to damage a charity’s reputation if trustees can show that they handled it well. If the media contact the Commission about an incident and it has been properly reported, we will be able to say that the trustees handled the situation responsibly and this will help protect the charity’s reputation.\nFor detailed guidance on trustee duties, see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-essential-trustee-what-you-need-to-know-cc3\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eThe essential trustee: what you need to know, what you need to do (CC3)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe Commission may need to provide regulatory advice or guidance or use its statutory powers: Timely reporting allows the Commission to identify problems in charities at an early stage and, where appropriate, to provide regulatory advice and guidance to trustees. Any regulatory advice and guidance provided will normally be limited to ensuring the trustees meet their legal duties. \nIn the most serious cases the Commission may need to use its statutory powers in order to protect the charity and put it back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe Commission can assess the risk to other charities: Serious incident reporting helps the Commission to measure the volume and impact of incidents within charities, to identify trends and to understand the risks facing the sector as a whole. This insight helps the Commission to warn charities about risks and give trustees the information and tools they need to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-to-report\"\u003eWhen to report\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should report an actual or alleged incident promptly. This means as soon as is reasonably possible after it happens, or immediately after your charity becomes aware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"whistleblowing--speaking-out-if-you-suspect-wrongdoing\"\u003eWhistleblowing – speaking out if you suspect wrongdoing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe serious incident reporting framework and this guidance is for trustees. If you’re an employee of a charity and you suspect serious wrongdoing within the organisation, for example criminal offences, malpractice/misconduct or health and safety breaches, you should usually raise this with your employers first, following the charity’s whistleblowing policy if it has one. If the charity fails to deal with your concerns appropriately or you continue to suspect serious wrongdoing, you can report this to the Commission – including anonymously if you wish to do so. In reporting your concerns to the Commission, you may be protected under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.

However, even if a charity does not have a duty of care in relation to those who come into contact with it through its work, its trustees may still need to think about whether or not certain steps need to be taken to address a risk of harm to these people. The steps that need to be taken, if any, will depend on the nature of the charity’s work and who it comes into contact with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor those charities providing activities and services to children or adults at risk, the term safeguarding has a particular meaning under UK legislation and practice guidance and may require reporting of incidents to statutory safeguarding agencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for the purposes of charity law and reporting obligations to the Commission as regulator, the Commission uses the term safeguarding as the range of measures in place to protect the people who come into contact with charities through their work from abuse and mistreatment of any kind (including neglect).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFailure by trustees to sufficiently manage safeguarding risks is of serious regulatory concern to the Commission and may be considered to be misconduct and/or mismanagement. It can also damage public trust and confidence in charities and impact upon the sector as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor further information about trustee duties in relation to safeguarding, you should read the Commission’s guidance \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-duties-for-charity-trustees\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eSafeguarding and protecting people for charities and trustees\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"types-of-safeguarding-incident-to-report\"\u003eTypes of safeguarding incident to report\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to make a report to the Commission if a serious safeguarding risk materialises.

The Commission would also expect to receive a report if the number and nature of staffing incidents indicate there are widespread or systematic issues connected to sexual harassment, abuse and/or other misconduct in a charity.

They may relate not just to a charity’s funds and financial assets, but also to other assets, such as databases and confidential or sensitive information. The impact on a charity can be significant, going beyond financial loss.

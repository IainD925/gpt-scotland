Measurements of the average temperature at the Earth’s surface show it has risen by about 1.1°C since the pre-industrial period. Each of the last 3 decades have been hotter than the previous one and the 7 warmest years on record have occurred between 2015 and 2021. This change in temperature hasn’t been the same everywhere. It has increased more over land than over the oceans and has been more than twice as fast in the Arctic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe United Kingdom (UK) is experiencing rising temperatures. The most recent decade (2012 to 2021) has been on average 1.0°C warmer than the 1961 to 1990 average. All 10 of the warmest years in the UK have occurred since 2003. 2022 was the UK’s hottest year on record, with an average year-round temperature above 10°C seen for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the climate is warming, temperatures aren’t expected to rise every single year. Natural fluctuations will still cause unusually cold years and seasons, but these events will become less likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with warming at the Earth’s surface, many other changes in the climate are occurring, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ewarming oceans\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emelting polar ice and glaciers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erising sea levels\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore extreme weather events\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"warming-oceans\"\u003eWarming oceans\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not only the temperature at the Earth’s surface that is rising. The temperature of the oceans has been increasing too. This warming has been seen all the way down to 2 km beneath the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe chemistry of the oceans is also changing. They have absorbed about one third of the total carbon dioxide emissions since 1980. This is causing the acidity of the oceans to increase 10 times faster than at any point in the last 65 million years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"melting-polar-ice-and-glaciers\"\u003eMelting polar ice and glaciers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past few decades, the ice sheets (the great masses of land ice at the poles) in Greenland and the Antarctic have shrunk. Glaciers have shrunk too, losing over 6000 giga-tonnes of ice over the last 30 years. Arctic Sea ice has decreased in area since the 1970s, by about 40% in September and about 10% in March. There is no significant trend in Antarctic Sea ice, likely due to other regional effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"rising-sea-levels\"\u003eRising sea levels\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMelting land ice and the expansion of water in warming oceans have caused sea levels to rise. Global sea level has risen by around 20 cm over the past century, likely faster than at any point in the last 3,000 years. The rate of sea level rise increased over the 20th century and sea levels will rise further this century. The extent to which they rise will depend on future amounts of greenhouse gas emissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-extreme-weather-events\"\u003eMore extreme weather events\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore damaging extreme weather events are being seen around the world. Heatwaves, heavy rainfall events and droughts are occurring more often, and they are more severe. We expect these trends to continue as greenhouse gases emissions and global temperature continue to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"causes-of-climate-change\"\u003eCauses of climate change\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (such as methane) in the atmosphere enhance the ‘greenhouse effect’. More of the Sun’s energy is trapped, causing the Earth to warm. Heating of the ocean accounts for over 90% of the trapped energy. Scientists have known about this greenhouse effect since the 19th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the warmer the Earth becomes. While the plants and the oceans absorb about half of the carbon dioxide from human activities, the rest goes into the atmosphere. Recent warming is being driven by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eburning fossil fuels for energy\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echanges in land use and deforestation which reduces the numbers of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eagricultural production which releases greenhouse gasses from energy use, from the number of livestock and the amount of fertiliser applied to land\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emanufacture of cement, chemicals and metals, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNatural influences on the climate, such as changes in the strength of the sun, or volcanic eruptions, can affect global temperature. But they have not contributed significantly to recent warming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"past-climate-change\"\u003ePast climate change\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAncient ice from the polar ice sheets is used to understand how temperatures have changed over hundreds of thousands of years. In addition, air bubbles trapped in the ice show that higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere correlate with warmer global temperatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIce cores also show that greenhouse gases have rapidly increased over the last 350 years to levels not seen for at least 800,000 years. Meanwhile, records from ocean sediments show that current levels of carbon dioxide are higher than they have been for at least 2 million years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"natural-fluctuations-in-climate\"\u003eNatural fluctuations in climate\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last million years or so, the Earth’s climate has had a natural cycle of cold glacial and warm inter-glacial periods. This cycle is mostly caused by gradual changes in the Earth’s orbit over many thousands of years. These changes affect the amount of energy that reaches the Earth. But they can be amplified by changes in greenhouse gases from natural causes, such as volcanic eruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe know that climate change has always occurred. But greenhouse gases produced by human activity are altering this cycle beyond this natural variation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eComplex computer models show a clear human ‘fingerprint’ on recent global warming. The latest Synthesis Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u003cabbr title=\"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\"\u003eIPCC\u003c/abbr\u003e) states that it is unequivocal that human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land, and that widespread and rapid changes to the climate have occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"climate-models-and-future-global-warming\"\u003eClimate models and future global warming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at changes that have already happened on Earth can tell us a lot about the future effects of climate change. But we can learn much more using mathematical models of the climate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSupercomputers (such as those at the Met Office) solve complex mathematical equations based on well-established physical laws to model the behaviour of the weather and climate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese models cannot provide very specific forecasts of what the weather will be on a given day more than a few days in the future. But they can predict large-scale changes in global climate in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClimate models can also show us the effects of changing our global greenhouse gas emissions. For example, if we reduce emissions to net zero around or after 2050, followed by negative carbon dioxide emissions, we could see average global temperatures limited to 1.5°C warmer than the pre-industrial period by the end of this century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, the average global temperature could become 4.4°C warmer over the same period. Because these are global averages, the temperature in regions such as the Arctic will likely be even higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more information, see the Met Office \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate-change/what-is-climate-change\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWhat is climate change\u003c/a\u003e page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"impacts-of-climate-change\"\u003eImpacts of climate change\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can already see the effects of climate change. They are projected to become more severe and widespread as greenhouse gas emissions and global temperatures continue to rise. How big these impacts are depends on the degree to which we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and on our ability to adapt to these changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the effects of changes to our climate include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003erisk to water supplies\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003elocalised flooding and flooding in coastal regions\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003edamage to marine ecosystems and associated failure of fisheries\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eloss of biodiversity\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eheat stress, affecting human health and habitability\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eincreased risk of wildfires\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efood insecurity as conditions for growing crops change and habitable region of pests expands\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeveloped countries produce most greenhouse gas emissions. But we expect developing countries to experience some of the most severe effects of climate change. With fewer resources to adapt to these changes, the impact on people in developing countries is likely to be higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more details, see the Met Office \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/climate-change/effects-of-climate-change\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEffects of climate change\u003c/a\u003e page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-effects-of-climate-change-on-the-uk\"\u003eThe effects of climate change on the UK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK’s climate is changing already.

But it is likely that we will see more of the weather listed above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, then by 2070, UK winters are forecast to be between 0.6 and 3.8°C warmer and between 3 to 39% wetter, depending on the region, compared to our climate in 1990. This is because warmer air can hold more water. We will likely experience heavier rains and more rain could fall during winter storms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, by 2070, UK summers are projected to be between 1.3 and 5.1°C warmer, depending on the region. Higher summer temperatures will likely cause more severe heatwaves. This will be a risk to public health, particularly vulnerable people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2022, UK temperatures exceeded 40°C for the first time on record. Temperatures remained above 20°C overnight and the highest daily minimum record was also broken. The chance of the UK seeing 40°C days could be 10 times more likely in the current climate than in the past. By 2070, regions in the south could have average hottest days reaching 40°C. Warmer, drier summers are likely to increase the risk of wildfires in the UK, as seen in the summer of 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eClimate change will also affect summer rainfall events in the UK. Flash flooding events are more likely, especially in urban areas. By 2070, the UK is forecast to experience flash floods twice as often as it did in 1990. Increased flooding will negatively affect the environment, infrastructure, transport and water systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease see the advice on staying safe and well:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/seasonal-advice/health-wellbeing/hot-weather-and-its-impacts\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ehot weather\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ein \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/seasonal-advice/your-home/what-to-do-in-a-flood\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003efloods\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-role-of-the-intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change-ipcc\"\u003eThe role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u003cabbr title=\"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\"\u003eIPCC\u003c/abbr\u003e)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u003cabbr title=\"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\"\u003eIPCC\u003c/abbr\u003e) is a scientific body of the United Nations.

Its overarching goal is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C requires reduced global carbon dioxide emissions to at least net zero by the 2050s and 2070s, respectively. Deep and sustained reductions in the emissions of all other greenhouse gases are also required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many benefits to limiting global warming, with each fraction of a degree making a substantial difference. The severity of the impacts of climate change increases with temperature and many changes are irreversible for centuries to millennia. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will always reduce risk, regardless of specific temperature goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo minimise the negative effects of climate change, actions to mitigate and adapt need to be taken in this decade.  Mitigation and adaptation action can provide other benefits. For example, reduced methane emissions will limit near-term warming and improve air quality. The benefits of such actions will be felt globally, such as improving agricultural productivity, increasing innovation, better health, and wellbeing, increasing food security, and reducing biodiversity loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/648fef30103ca6000c03a0d6/climate-change-explained.pdf\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--custom\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/648fef30103ca6001303a147/thumbnail_climate-change-explained.pdf.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/648fef30103ca6000c03a0d6/climate-change-explained.pdf\"\u003eClimate change explained, with references\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e241 KB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e8 pages\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e",

It provides information about the eligibility criteria and application process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders who need further or more detailed help should contact the Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) \u003ca href=\"mailto:C2L@studentbursarysupport.co.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eC2L@studentbursarysupport.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e who administer C2L on behalf of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-summary-of-care-to-learn\"\u003eA summary of Care to Learn\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L provides funding for childcare to help young parents (defined as those aged under 20) continue in education after the birth of a child.  The scheme provides funding for childcare whilst the young parent is engaged in a study programme and is not able to provide care for their child.  It can also help with travel costs involved in taking the child to the childcare provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L provides funding for childcare whilst young parents are on work placements, where these are a defined part of the study programme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eC2L pays up to a maximum amount of £160 per child per week or up to a maximum of £175 per child per week in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible, the young parent’s study programme must have some public funding and their childcare provision must be registered with Ofsted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo get C2L, the young parent, their education institution and their childcare provider must all meet the eligibility criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents must complete and submit a new application each academic year even if their study programme runs for more than one year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYoung parents should apply for C2L before the start of their study programme or as soon as possible after they start.  If young parents apply after the start of their study programme, it is important they know that payments can only be backdated to the beginning of their study programme if their application is received within 28 days of the start date. For any applications received outside of this timeframe payments will only begin from the Monday of the week the SBSS receive the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders should tell young parents about the availability of financial support for childcare through C2L to help them make more informed decisions about their options.

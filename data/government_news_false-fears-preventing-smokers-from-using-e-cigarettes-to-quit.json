It also takes an in depth look at the evidence on e-cigarette use in people with mental health conditions and pregnant women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent vaping use has remained stable in adults and young people since the last report. Of concern is the increasing number of smokers that now believe vaping is more harmful than smoking. This is out of line with expert reviews from the UK and \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2018/public-health-consequences-of-e-cigarettes.aspx\"\u003eUS\u003c/a\u003e concluding that using regulated nicotine vaping products is far less harmful than smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePHE’s advice remains that smokers should switch to e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking, but non-smokers should not take up vaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eE-cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco but are not completely safe. They contain significantly less harmful chemicals which cause diseases related to smoking but the long-term impact of using e-cigarettes will remain unknown for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe mistaken belief that e-cigarettes are more harmful than smoking increased rapidly among UK smokers following the US lung injury outbreak in autumn 2019. US authorities have now confirmed that vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent added to cannabis vaping products, was a primary cause of the US outbreak. This substance is banned from UK-regulated nicotine vaping products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe report identifies a need for continued monitoring of public perceptions, as the researchers fear that smokers are being deterred by safety fears from using e-cigarettes to quit, which will ultimately cost lives. The report also warns that a ban on flavoured liquids could also deter some smokers from switching to e-cigarettes completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSmokers should continue to be encouraged to try regulated nicotine vaping products along with other stop smoking aids and behavioural support, to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe report also reviews the evidence on vaping among people with mental health conditions and pregnant women, two of the groups among whom the government is focusing its efforts to reduce smoking rates, as set out in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobacco-control-plan-for-england\"\u003eTobacco Control Plan for England\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers reviewed the literature on vaping among people with mental health conditions and found a small amount of research showing vaping products may reduce smoking, though further research is needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey also found health professionals need better information and training to support people with mental health conditions to use e-cigarettes to quit smoking. PHE has today published \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-use-by-patients-in-nhs-mental-health-organisations\"\u003eadvice on vaping in NHS mental health trusts\u003c/a\u003e. To promote consistency in smokefree policy and practice across such trusts, the advice recommends being clear about where people can and cannot vape in hospital grounds and buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers also reviewed the available literature on vaping among pregnant women and found that more research is needed to understand the prevalence, safety and effectiveness of using e-cigarettes in pregnancy. In the meantime, health professionals should use the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://smokefreeaction.org.uk/smokefree-nhs/smoking-in-pregnancy-challenge-group/smoking-in-pregnancy-challenge-group-resources/e-cigarettes-in-pregnancy/\"\u003ecurrently available advice on using e-cigarettes during pregnancy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe report recommends that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eproof of age at sale of vaping products needs to be better enforced to protect young people\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ehealth professionals should use advice on using e-cigarettes during pregnancy\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore research is needed into vaping among smokers with mental health conditions and pregnant smokers\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003emore research is needed into e-cigarette flavour preferences among young people\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, commented on the review:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eIt is concerning to see how much the US lung disease outbreak has affected smokers’ views on e-cigarettes here in the UK. Safety fears may well be deterring many smokers from switching, leaving them on a path to years of ill health and an early death due to their smoking.

In our review we present evidence that suggests in England, vaping has not undermined declines in adult smoking, and for youth, vaping is mainly concentrated in those who were already dabbling in cigarette smoking. However, we need to remain vigilant and ensure that vaping products, alongside regular cigarettes, are not easily accessible to young people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePHE has commissioned a full review of the evidence on the safety of e-cigarettes, which will be published in 2022. King’s College London will work with a number of different researchers from the UK and US (including some who contributed to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s e-cigarette report in in 2018) to conduct this review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah Arnott, Chief Executive of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eThere are over 6 million smokers in England and smoking is still the leading cause of premature death and disease particularly among the most disadvantaged in our society. Helping more smokers quit is vital if we’re to achieve the government’s vision of a smokefree society by 2030, and vaping has a role to play. Vaping has helped many thousands of smokers quit to date. But many thousands more could benefit if they were not put off by the persistent, worsening and inaccurate beliefs the public hold about vaping. Smokers should be reassured by today’s authoritative and detailed report which shows that the UK’s e-cigarette regulations are effective and vaping remains a safer alternative to smoking. I urge smokers to have confidence in our regulatory system and not be put off by alarmist headlines about the risk of vaping which are not backed up by the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Butterworth, Cancer Research UK’s Senior Policy Manager, said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"last-child\"\u003eE-cigarettes are a relatively new product, they aren’t risk free and we don’t yet know their long-term impact. So we strongly discourage non-smokers from using them. But research so far shows that vaping is less harmful than smoking tobacco and can help people to stop smoking. This report gives further reassurance to smokers about the relative harms of e-cigarettes compared to smoking tobacco, and also shows the UK is not seeing a rapid uptake in vaping among non-smokers and children, which is good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaping-in-england-evidence-update-march-2020\"\u003eLink to full report\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.smokinginengland.info/\"\u003eSmoking Toolkit Study\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobacco-control-plan-for-england\"\u003eTowards a Smokefree Generation: A Tobacco Control Plan for England\u003c/a\u003e Department of Health, July 2017\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNHS Digital, \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/smoking-drinking-and-drug-use-among-young-people-in-england/2018\"\u003eSmoking, drinking and drug use among young people in England 2018\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eNHS Digital, \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-smoking/statistics-on-smoking-england-2019\"\u003eStatistics on Smoking: England, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eUS National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (January 2018) \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2018/public-health-consequences-of-e-cigarettes.aspx\"\u003ePublic Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRoyal College of Physicians, \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harm-reduction\"\u003eNicotine without smoke: tobacco harm reduction\u003c/a\u003e (April 2016)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eA.

It also sets out the elements of sustainable forestry management, such as biodiversity, climate change, historic environment, landscape, people, soil and water, and explains how to consider your project against each. Conveniently, these also broadly overlap with the requirements under the forestry \u003cabbr title=\"Environmental Impact Assessment\"\u003eEIA\u003c/abbr\u003e regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forestry Commission makes it easier for you to design a \u003cabbr title=\"UK Forestry Standard\"\u003eUKFS\u003c/abbr\u003e-compliant afforestation project by offering the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-planning-grant\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWoodland Creation Planning Grant\u003c/a\u003e. If you intend to apply for this grant, you must do so before submitting a forestry \u003cabbr title=\"Environmental Impact Assessment\"\u003eEIA\u003c/abbr\u003e application to the Forestry Commission. Much of the data that you will be funded to gather may be submitted as part of a subsequent \u003cabbr title=\"Environmental Impact Assessment\"\u003eEIA\u003c/abbr\u003e application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"all-new-planting-over-10ha-including-restocking-an-alternative-area\"\u003eAll new planting over 10ha (including restocking an alternative area)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"contact-the-local-planning-authority-to-assess-landscape-impact\"\u003eContact the local planning authority to assess landscape impact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarger projects, such as large-scale woodland planting are likely to have a significant visual impact on the landscape.

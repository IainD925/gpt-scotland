Erwinase® is an aparinginase enzyme that is used as part of the treatment protocols in conjunction with radiotherapy  or chemotherapy. The product has been particularly successful over a number of years and survival rates without remission for this type of cancer are now high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAsparagine is an amino acid that is essential for cell growth; it is produced by most but not all cells. Mutated cancer cells in \u003cabbr title=\"acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\"\u003eALL\u003c/abbr\u003e rely on asparagine circulating in the blood for growth. L-asparaginases are a group of enzymes that lower circulating asparagine levels in the blood, thereby depriving the mutated blood cells of asparagine and inhibiting their growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several different types of L-asparaginase available on the market, each derived from a different bacterium. Patients receiving treatment with L-asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (E. coli), who develop hypersensitivity to that form of the enzyme, may be able to continue treatment with Erwinase® as the enzymes are immunologically distinct. Antibodies targeting E. coli derived L-Asparaginase have been shown not to cross-react with Erwinase®.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe product is manufactured in \u003cabbr title=\"Public Health England\"\u003ePHE\u003c/abbr\u003e’s licensed pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.

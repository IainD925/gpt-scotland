Institutions have discretion to decide which students receive RBF support and how much they receive but ESFA expects that the majority of the students receiving RBF will be studying in a designated specialist subject area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rbf-policy-in-the-2017-to-2018-academic-year\"\u003eRBF policy in the 2017 to 2018 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF provides financial help towards the costs of accommodation for students attending one of the designated institutions delivering specialist provision.  This is provision that students need to be resident to participate in because it is not available locally and/or because it needs students to be available at unsociable hours on a regular basis. RBF enables young people to gain a substantial qualification in a specialist subject that they would not be able to get at a non-specialist institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF provides a contribution towards residential costs.  Institutions should target the funding at students they assess face the most significant financial barriers to participation. RBF is not to provide support to all students on residentially delivered provision, or to necessarily cover the full costs for each student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA expects that most RBF funding will be used for accommodation costs. Accommodation might be in private lodgings or accommodation that is  owned or managed by the institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF can be used to help with travel costs between the student’s term time lodgings and the institution where appropriate. RBF cannot be used for travel costs for non-residential students, in other words, for home to institution travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions use RBF for travel costs for residential students living off campus, the amount they spend must not exceed 15% of their total RBF allocation. To make sure RBF maintains its primary focus on residential support, spend on travel is also capped at £25,000. This means that where 15% of the institution’s allocation would be greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum the institution can spend on travel costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf institutions face exceptional circumstances and feel that more needs to be spent on travel, they should submit a business case to ESFA by e-mailing: \u003ca href=\"mailto:enquiries.efa@education.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eenquiries.efa@education.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\nInstitutions can use up to 5% of their allocation for administrative costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"student-eligibility\"\u003eStudent Eligibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for RBF in the 2017 to 2018 academic year, students must be aged 16 or over but under 19 on 31 August 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents aged 19 or over are eligible for RBF if they are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’) or have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"residency\"\u003eResidency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must meet the residency criteria set out in the 2017 to 2018 academic year \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eESFA Funding Regulations\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"household-income\"\u003eHousehold income\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should target RBF towards those students facing the most significant financial barriers to participation.  They should assess the student’s actual need for help with residential costs before awarding RBF support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should take account of the young person’s household income when deciding how much RBF to award.  Household income must be verified by evidence, for example, an award notice showing receipt of benefits, a P60, Tax Credit Award Notice, evidence of self-employment income etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"assessment-and-payment-of-rbf\"\u003eAssessment and payment of RBF\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs RBF is awarded to institutions because they are delivering specialist provision, ESFA expects that the majority of RBF funding will be used to support students enrolled on this provision.  However, institutions have the discretion, in line with this guide, to decide which students get RBF support and how much support they should get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should manage the number and size of RBF awards they make to keep within their budget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should assess each student’s actual need for help with residential costs by assessing their household income, before deciding whether to award RBF support. RBF should not be awarded just because a student is enrolled in residentially delivered provision. Institutions should publish their RBF policy to help students understand the criteria against which they will be assessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF payments for accommodation must be made directly to the student’s landlord.  The landlord may be the institution itself if they provide accommodation directly or a private landlord. No payments should be made directly to the student as these payments would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income related Benefits Regulations 2000).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents can receive benefits and/or other forms of financial support at the same time as RBF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may wish to keep a contingency fund to respond to needs that come up later in the academic year such as a change in a student’s circumstances rather than allocating all funds at the start of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may use RBF to help residential students with the cost of travel from their term time lodgings to site (up to a maximum of 15% of their allocation, capped at £25,000). The use of RBF for travel costs does not replace the statutory duty on local authorities to set out, in an annually published transport statement, the arrangements they will make to facilitate the participation in education or training of young people of sixth form age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should not use RBF for any purpose designed to give them a competitive advantage over other institutions.  RBF should not be used for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efees for access to college facilities\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eblock subsidy of transport\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecosts that are in the scope of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echildcare costs that are in the scope of the Care to Learn scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should take account of equalities legislation when administering RBF.  This means they must not discriminate against their students based on their protected characteristics. Institutions are also subject to the public sector equality duty in section 149(1) of the Equality Act 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should explain to students how they can complain or appeal about any decision relating to RBF support and/or if are unhappy about the way in which their application for RBF support was handled.  All complaints should be made by following the institution’s normal complaints procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"allocations\"\u003eAllocations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eESFA has based RBF allocations for the 2017 to 2018 academic year on the:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eaverage actual RBF spend over the 3  previous years; or\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe amount of RBF allocated in the 2016 to 2017 academic year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the 2017 to 2018 academic year, ESFA has also applied growth to allocations generated by the methodology above.

At the meeting the company may present their intentions, a short summary of the dossier and raise any special issues such as requests for consideration for conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) or marketing authorisation (MA) under exceptional circumstances. Pre-submission meetings offer opportunity to enhance joined up work with the HTA evaluation process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe services of the MHRA Innovation Office are also available to provide access to world-class expertise within the MHRA regulatory centre, as well as from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/mhra-innovation-office\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMHRA Innovation Office\u003c/a\u003e is open to all innovation queries - particularly those that challenge the current regulatory framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"prioritising-access-to-new-medicines\"\u003ePrioritising Access to New Medicines\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MHRA is working with partner organisations in the UK to develop approaches to reduce the time to patient access for new medicines and technologies that will benefit patients.  The key features of the approach will include a new medicine designation that links to the development of a roadmap to patient access in the UK healthcare system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe roadmap will provide a clear pathway for product development, offering a toolkit of support options and providing a platform for sustained multi-stakeholder interactions. The toolkit is intended to drive efficiencies in the development programme by supporting data generation and advising on evidence requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn integrated pathway will pull together expertise from across the MHRA and partners in the wider healthcare system such as NICE, with multiple entry points available to developers. Further detailed information will be published by December.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"accelerated-assessment-procedure\"\u003eAccelerated Assessment Procedure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee information on this procedure in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-150-day-assessment-for-national-applications-for-medicines\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance on 150-day assessment for national applications for medicines\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"guidance-on-the-rolling-review-route\"\u003eGuidance on the Rolling Review route\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rolling Review is a new route for marketing authorisation applications, intended to enhance development of novel medicines. It does this by offering on-going regulatory input and feedback enabling the applicants to ‘get it right first time’ and ensuring that applications can be approved as efficiently as possible. Fees applicable will be published in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"eligibility\"\u003eEligibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications for any new active substances including biological products that wish to obtain a marketing authorisation in Great Britain based on submission of a ‘full dossier’ to the MHRA are eligible for a rolling review. Similar biological applications (biosimilar products) are also eligible for rolling review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"process-and-sequence\"\u003eProcess and sequence\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process is a phased, modular, iterative approach to evaluation of marketing authorisation applications. The quality, non-clinical and clinical modules may be submitted separately or in combination depending on the individual circumstances as data becomes available. It is expected that each module will be near completion to avoid multiple iterations of assessment of the same module.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach assessment phase will progress independently, and any questions raised will offer the applicant the opportunity and time for a comprehensive update of the modules prior to final submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final phase will involve submission of a complete application including updated versions of the modules evaluated previously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompliance with GB paediatric requirements are expected to be addressed prior to the final phase. The final assessment is expected to be a single phase with the decision on approval of the marketing authorisation. The Risk Management Plans (RMP) will also be part of the final evaluation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnhanced regulatory interaction and advice will be available during the rolling review process supporting the development process and reducing the risk of delay at the final stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"expert-input\"\u003eExpert input\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsultation with expert advisory groups is anticipated at each stage and with CHM and therapy areas experts prior to grant of the MA. The MHRA will publish further information on the details of the scheme in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"recognition-of-a-european-commission-licensing-decision-for-products-approved-in-the-community-marketing-authorisation-procedure-and-recognition-of-marketing-authorisation-approval-decisions-taken-by-european-union-member-states-in-decentralised-and-mutual-recognition-procedures\"\u003eRecognition of a European Commission licensing decision for products approved in the community marketing authorisation procedure and recognition of marketing authorisation approval decisions taken by European Union Member States in decentralised and mutual recognition procedures.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor two years from 1 January 2021, Great Britain will adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorisations in the community marketing authorisation procedure .\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications should include all information provided to EMA during the licensing procedure and should be accompanied by all iterations of the CHMP assessment report including the final CHMP opinion. A declaration of conformity of the Great Britain application with the dossier approved by the European Commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarketing authorisation applications should be submitted to the MHRA following receipt of the CHMP opinion and will be determined following confirmation of notification of the EC decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll UK national requirements apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe UK will also have the power to take into account marketing authorisation decisions of EU Member States when considering applications for marketing authorisations for products that have been approved in decentralised or mutual recognition procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications should include all information submitted to the reference Member State and accompanied by all iterations of the RMS assessment report, including the RMS end of procedure notification. A declaration of conformity of the UK application with the dossier approved in the RMS should be provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe application should be submitted to the MHRA following receipt of the RMS end of procedure notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll UK national requirements apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications will be reviewed for compliance with UK specific requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGuidance on supply of medicines from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under Unfettered Access will be provided in due course\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFees applicable to GB marketing authorisations taking account of an EU decision will be published in due course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApplications should be submitted through the MHRA portal.

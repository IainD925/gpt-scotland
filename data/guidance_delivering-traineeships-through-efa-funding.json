However, we will only fund traineeship growth if an institution is also over-delivering against its overall 16 to 19 study programme allocation. If an institution is under-delivering against its 16 to 19 study programme allocation, it will not be eligible for traineeship growth funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor \u003cabbr title=\"Independent learning providers\"\u003eILPs\u003c/abbr\u003e, over-delivery will be a cash based calculation and for grant-funded institutions it will be a student based calculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach institution will have a traineeships cap beyond which growth funding cannot be guaranteed. For the majority of providers, the traineeships cap will allow them to at least double the size of their traineeship delivery. The traineeships cap is in place so that we are able to manage our budget. If possible, and should budget allow, we will increase the traineeships cap during the year to encourage further traineeship delivery or pay for traineeship growth already delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo measure the growth in traineeships, we will set a baseline for each individual provider based on historic traineeship delivery.

Work experience in traineeships should give the young person experience of a real workplace so they can develop the skills, knowledge, confidence, attitudes and behaviours they need to succeed at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, work experience should be with an external employer, external to the learning environment and at an external site. However, exceptions to this will be funded. For example, local authorities with a training arm where the direct provision of training is clearly not the local authority’s core business, work experience within departments which are separate to the training arm counts as external work experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn these cases, providers will need to make a judgement about whether their work placements genuinely provide students with the experiences they need to develop the work-related attributes expected of a traineeship.

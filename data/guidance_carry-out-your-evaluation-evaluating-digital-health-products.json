Someone who has no evaluation experience can still be involved in many evaluation activities, such as creating a model of how your product works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should engage colleagues with relevant evaluation experience. They can provide support for your project and help fill skills gaps in your team. For example, if you want to use a qualitative method for your evaluation, seek support from someone who has experience of those methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInvolve specialists at an early stage in the evaluation planning process. Statisticians shouldn’t only become involved when it comes to analysing data. They should be involved in decisions about the evaluation question, sampling and data collection.

For example, your team might collect data and an external team could analyse it and report back. This could help to reduce the costs of using external evaluators, while reducing the need for particular skills and experience in your team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you choose this approach, you should still involve the external team at an early stage in the process.

If anything changes during your evaluation, update it to explain what changed and why. Be transparent about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA protocol is not a living document. It should be fixed before you start because approvals you obtain are based on what you said in your protocol. However, if anything changes during the evaluation, you will need to explain this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you have conducted your evaluation, your plan or protocol will form a good basis for \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-your-results-evaluating-digital-health-products\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ewriting up your findings\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"approvals-and-ethics\"\u003eApprovals and ethics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may need specific approvals to carry out some types of evaluation. All evaluations involving people should be carried out ethically and legally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProcedures to check whether your evaluation is appropriate vary depending on the context you’re working in.

You should have designed your digital health product or service to minimise the risk of harm. Are there any changes to this because of the evaluation? For example, if you are evaluating a new version of an app that includes a dose calculator, you would need to make sure this had gone through appropriate checks. You should consider any safeguarding requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndividuals should consent to be part of research. How formal this is depends on the type of evaluation. You may want to mention evaluation in the terms and conditions for your digital product if you intend to use routine data in evaluations. If something new or different will happen as part of the evaluation, individuals need to know this and indicate their consent. The Health Research Authority website has \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/consent/examples.html\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eexample and template consent forms\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eData from participants should be treated confidentially.

When writing up evaluation results, it’s usual to use either group statistics or anonymisation to protect the confidentiality of individuals. For example, in qualitative studies, you might use quotations from interviews, but anonymise them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhich governance procedures apply to you depends on what you are doing and in what context. Evaluations of existing products or services that do not involve doing anything different to participants are usually classed as audits or service evaluations. These require less oversight in the NHS and other regulatory frameworks. If you are doing something new to individuals as part of the evaluation or if you are randomising participants to receive different interventions, this may come under research ethics frameworks.

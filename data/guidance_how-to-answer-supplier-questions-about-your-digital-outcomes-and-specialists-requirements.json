If a supplier needs to clarify something in your requirements, they can ask you a question, also known as a ‘clarification’ question, through the Digital Marketplace. You must respond so the supplier can decide whether a piece of work is right for them and whether to offer their services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you publish your requirements, suppliers will be given a date by which they must ask any questions they have. This should give you enough time to answer them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-youll-know-if-a-supplier-has-asked-a-question\"\u003eHow you’ll know if a supplier has asked a question\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a supplier asks a question, you’ll be sent an email to the address you gave when you created your Digital Marketplace account. Ensure this email address will be monitored. If you’re away during the time when suppliers can ask questions, you should make sure your emails are forwarded to a colleague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"answering-questions-in-an-open-and-transparent-way\"\u003eAnswering questions in an open and transparent way\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must make sure that suppliers have access to the same information about the work. This means all suppliers will have an equal opportunity to win the contract.

All suppliers will see your response, and the supplier can then rephrase their question and ask it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou must not reveal commercially sensitive information when you answer a supplier question, for example the supplier’s price for the work or how they plan to solve your problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"holding-a-session-to-answer-supplier-questions\"\u003eHolding a session to answer supplier questions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can hold a question and answer session to answer a lot of supplier questions at the same time. This should mean that suppliers don’t ask duplicate questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you give suppliers 1 week to apply to a specialists requirement, your question and answer session must be in the first 2 working days after you publish.

The underlying principle is that the method must be both fair and reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"deutsche-ruck\"\u003eDeutsche Rück\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis concerned a contract of reinsurance. The taxpayer received a supply of legal services in order to quantify a claim made under that contract. The High Court decided that the expense concerned was a cost component of the reinsurance service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen applying the Deutsche Rück principles to the supply of insurance, HMRC consider the expenses incurred settling a contract of insurance to be a cost component of the supply even though they are incurred long after the premium has been paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"sectors\"\u003eSectors\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSectors are used within partial exemption to sub divide a special method calculation into different business areas. Rather than having a single calculation, a sectorised method enables each different parts of a business to adopt a separate calculation appropriate to its circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese individual calculations are then combined to determine the recoverable VAT for the business as a whole. The use of sectors improves accuracy and lessens the risk of distortion. However, adding sectors increases complexity and compliance cost. Furthermore, unless sectors are chosen objectively they risk undermining fairness and certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHMRC encourages the use of sectors in large partly exempt businesses to lessen the risk of unfair VAT recovery (either too much or too little). Sectors are particularly important for diverse businesses, such as large insurers that undertake a range of activities for which different sets of costs are incurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHMRC consider that such businesses should benefit from sectorising their special methods based on the operational sub-divisions within their organisation (such as business units for which separate accounts are prepared), and then allocating costs between these sectors in line with their internal cost accounting procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSectors should arise naturally out of the way a business is organised and should not be an artificial creation just for the purposes of partial exemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs stated above, sectors ideally should be aligned to the business divisions. If separate records have to be created in order to operate a sector, it suggests that the sector is not a natural one but is being created solely for partial exemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSectors should ideally follow the existing commercial divisions in the business. In many cases this is likely to mean sectors based on either individual companies or collective groups of companies with similar activities, although a business (and thus its natural sectors) can also be organised along the lines of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003especific function\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003egeographic area\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eproduct\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eproject\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese are just illustrative examples. Regulatory requirements might create another natural division, particularly for insurance businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few situations, where HMRC feel that a distortion could result, HMRC will use its powers which allow for the creation of separate sectors for distortive transactions, such as sales of securities, or supplies from overseas branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is good practice to include a sector to deal with input tax that is not dealt with elsewhere in the method. This catch-all sector may also be used to deal with a new business organisation or activity that has yet to be addressed in the method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is good practice to include a use-based sector to include major projects such as corporate rebranding, major relocation of business, mergers and acquisitions that need to be notified to the Stock Exchange (restructuring or acquisition or disposal costs of businesses) and anything outside the usual run of business. The use basis also enables the insurer to contact HMRC to discuss and agree a suitable basis for apportionment, as and when the need arises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is good practice to define a sector in terms of the activity it covers, rather than the legal entity which carries it out. Another area where PESMs and the business organisations may not be fully aligned is the names given to \u003cabbr title=\"Partial Exemption Special Method\"\u003ePESM\u003c/abbr\u003e sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003cabbr title=\"Partial Exemption Special Method\"\u003ePESM\u003c/abbr\u003e is usually in place for a number of years, and as highlighted above, the business may reorganise, merge etc. Although convenient for the business, the business name may change over time, or activities within it may change or be discontinued. Therefore, HMRC consider it best practice to identify sectors by their activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common sectors within insurance businesses can

It is also important to understand the basis, and the extent to which, central costs (such as head office, IT and infrastructure costs) are reallocated to profit centres as these costs may represent significant expenditure which needs to be allocated to the income-earning sectors within the partial exemption method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHead office departments may also make some supplies, for example within treasury, IT, catering, or from within the insurance company’s own property portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA cost allocation method based on marginal costs (which might be more relevant for decision making purposes) should be treated with caution. This is because partial exemption is concerned with full cost allocation; both variable and fixed costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarginal costing can result in unfair recovery within the partial exemption method and is a relatively common source of dispute when businesses introduce new (typically exempt) activities the marginal cost of which is minimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere may be instances where a allocation methodology is insufficient or unsuitable to form the basis for a partial exemption method as it stands. In these instances, the insurer will need to suitably adapt the methodology for partial exemption. The most common methodologies are those based on headcount or floor space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"headcount-allocation\"\u003eHeadcount allocation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHeadcount is often used as the underlining basis for cost accounting methodology. However, headcount can also be used independently of a cost accounting methodology as a proxy for use-based allocation. To ensure a consistent approach is taken when addressing full- and part-time working, many organisations will apply full-time methodology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso the definition needs to clearly state which staff are to be included and which staff are to be excluded. Income generating staff should be included. This should include front office, middle office and back office who are closely connected with generating the income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe key issue is to ensure that there is a degree of parity between the staff included within the calculation. This may have to be achieved by the use of weighting.

Identify input tax on costs used wholly for making taxable supplies. This input tax is normally recoverable in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(ii) Direct attribution to exempt supplies.

This input tax is normally irrecoverable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(iii) Direct allocation to partial exemption ‘sectors’ (business sub-units described in the special method). Identify input tax on costs used wholly within a sector making both taxable and exempt supplies. This input tax is apportioned between taxable and exempt supplies by application of a pro-rata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e(iv) Allocation re shared costs.

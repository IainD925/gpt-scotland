This guidance explains what you need to do if you are considering a grant to an organisation that isn’t (or may not be) a charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe principles in this guidance are relevant to any charitable grant-giving.  If you only want to fund other charities, whether they are registered with the Commission or not, see also the Commission’s guidance: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-with-other-charities\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eWork with other charities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"grant-funding-an-organisation-that-is-not-a-charity\"\u003eGrant-funding an organisation that is not a charity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrant-funding can create opportunities for charities to further their purposes by reaching individuals or communities that they might not otherwise be able to reach. It can benefit causes or groups which may otherwise struggle to obtain the support they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis can include making grants to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eother charities with similar or overlapping purposes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eorganisations that aren’t charities including social enterprises, campaigning organisations, commercial companies or public sector bodies\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eorganisations based overseas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaking grants to organisations that aren’t charities may present new opportunities to further your charity’s purposes. Grants can be for specific activities or services or, in some cases, to develop the organisation’s capacity to deliver activities or outcomes that will further the charity’s own purposes. Remember though, that organisations which aren’t charities don’t have to deliver public benefit or comply with charitable purposes, and may be unfamiliar with charity law requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo you need to understand the relevant risks and boundaries, as well as the opportunities, before you start. Any grant your charity makes must only be used to further or support your charity’s purposes, and for no other purpose. This means there will always be limits and conditions on what you can fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-key-steps-and-considerations\"\u003eThe key steps and considerations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003csection class=\"gem-c-attachment govuk-!-display-none-print govuk-!-margin-bottom-6\" data-module=\"ga4-link-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82273b40f0b6230269b1ef/Charities_funding_non_charitable_organisations_at_a_glance.pdf\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image gem-c-attachment__thumbnail-image--custom\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82273940f0b6230269b1ee/thumbnail_Charities_funding_non_charitable_organisations_at_a_glance.pdf.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"gem-c-attachment__details\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2 class=\"gem-c-attachment__title\"\u003e\n      \u003ca class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_self\" data-ga4-link=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"file_download\",\"type\":\"attachment\"}\u0027 href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82273b40f0b6230269b1ef/Charities_funding_non_charitable_organisations_at_a_glance.pdf\"\u003eWhat to consider when deciding to award a grant (infographic)\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e\u003cabbr title=\"Portable Document Format\" class=\"gem-c-attachment__abbr\"\u003ePDF\u003c/abbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e1.87 MB\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=\"gem-c-attachment__attribute\"\u003e1 page\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n      \u003cp class=\"gem-c-attachment__metadata\"\u003eThis file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdetails class=\"gem-c-details govuk-details govuk-!-margin-bottom-3\" data-module=\"govuk-details gem-details ga4-event-tracker\"\u003e\n  \u003csummary class=\"govuk-details__summary\" data-details-track-click=\"\" data-ga4-event=\u0027{\"event_name\":\"select_content\",\"type\":\"detail\",\"text\":\"Request an accessible format.\",\"section\":\"Request an accessible format.\",\"index_section\":1}\u0027\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"govuk-details__summary-text\" data-ga4-expandable\u003e\n      Request an accessible format.\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/summary\u003e  \u003cdiv class=\"govuk-details__text\"\u003e\n    \n        If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a version of this document in a more accessible format, please email \u003ca href=\"mailto:usability@charitycommission.gov.uk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eusability@charitycommission.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e.

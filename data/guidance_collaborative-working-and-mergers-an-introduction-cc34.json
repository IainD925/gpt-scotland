It involves the transfer of assets and liabilities from charities to the charity they are merging with. Read the Commission’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-mergers-work-helping-you-succeed\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eguidance about mergers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"must-and-should-what-the-commission-means\"\u003e‘Must’ and ‘should’: what the Commission means\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe word ‘must’ is used where there is a specific legal or regulatory requirement that you must comply with. ‘Should’ is used for minimum good practice guidance you should follow unless there’s a good reason not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"technical-terms-used-in-this-guidance\"\u003eTechnical terms used in this guidance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuty of care: all trustees have a duty of care towards their charity. For the trustees of unincorporated charities, the Trustee Act 2000 defines the level of care and the particular circumstances in which it must be used. This standard means that a trustee is expected to use their knowledge and experience reasonably and in the interests of the charity. If they do so, they are unlikely to breach charity law. Where a trustee has professional or business expertise then they are expected to make use of this in running the charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough, strictly, this duty of care only applies in certain situations defined in the Act, legal precedent and good practice mean that the duty of care should be considered as applying to all aspects of trustees’ work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Act does not apply to charitable companies, the general principles of charity law mean that similar duties and principles apply to trustees who are directors as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuty of prudence: trustees must:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eensure that the charity is and will remain solvent\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003euse charitable funds and assets wisely, and only in furtherance of the charity’s purposes\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eavoid undertaking activities that might place the charity’s funds, endowments or other assets, or reputation, at undue risk\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003etake special care when investing the funds of the charity, or borrowing funds for the charity to use\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGoverning document: means any document which sets out the charity’s purposes and, usually, how it is to be administered. It may be a trust deed, constitution, memorandum and articles of association, conveyance, will, Royal Charter, scheme of the Commission or other formal document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrustees means charity trustees: charity trustees are the people who serve on the governing body of a charity. They may be known as trustees, directors, board members, governors, or committee members or some other title. They are responsible for the general control and management of the administration of the charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"collaborative-working\"\u003eCollaborative working\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-does-the-term-collaborative-working-cover\"\u003eWhat does the term collaborative working cover?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-short-answer\"\u003eThe short answer\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollaborative working describes joint working by two or more charities in order to fulfil their purposes, whilst remaining as separate organisations. This may relate to any aspect of the charities’ activity, including administration, fundraising, raising public profiles, resource sharing and streamlining of costs and service delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"in-more-detail\"\u003eIn more detail\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollaborative working can cover a wide range of activities. At the informal end of the spectrum it can include networking, sharing of information and membership of associations, groups or federations. While these examples of informal collaboration have an important role to play, this guidance focuses principally on more formal partnership projects and other collaborative ventures. Examples include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eoutsourcing functions such as finance, information systems support and payroll services\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esharing resources such as training or transport\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eco-locating and sharing accommodation and premises\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eworking arrangements which increase access and participation and enable charities to develop diversity in their services\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eformal partnerships between organisations in which resources are pooled to secure staff or services that none could afford on their own\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ejoint projects or programmes for aspects of service delivery or campaigning\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-general-points-should-be-considered-when-thinking-of-working-collaboratively\"\u003eWhat general points should be considered when thinking of working collaboratively?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-short-answer-legal-requirement\"\u003eThe short answer (legal requirement)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrustees must act prudently in the interests of their charity. In practice this means that the benefits of collaborative working should be clearly established at the outset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, collaborative working does not require the Commission to be involved as the arrangements are likely to fall within the trustees’ existing powers. However, depending on the nature of the collaboration, trustees may need to consider whether to take specialist professional advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"in-more-detail-1\"\u003eIn more detail\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore entering into a collaborative arrangement with another organisation, as good practice trustees are recommended to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esatisfy themselves that there will be adequate benefits to their users and beneficiaries, which could include:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ecost benefits\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eimprovements to the quality of service\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ethe ability to reach more beneficiaries, thus ensuring improved access to the services the charity provides\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eidentify the key success factors for the collaboration, which could include:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003earrangements which value each party’s independence\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ecompatible activities and organisational structures\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ea clear definition of, and accounting for, what each of the relevant charities is responsible and liable for\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eagreements which are proportionate to the relative risks and complexity of the collaboration\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003ea termination clause in any formal contract\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the size and complexity of the proposed arrangement, trustees should assess the risks involved to ensure that these have been sufficiently addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-sort-of-legal-issues-might-arise\"\u003eWhat sort of legal issues might arise?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-short-answer-legal-requirement-1\"\u003eThe short answer (legal requirement)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are unlikely to be any legal barriers for charities working collaboratively, providing they are all furthering their charitable purposes. However, depending upon the nature of the collaboration, charities may need to draw up legal agreements or contracts that protect each charity’s interests. In all circumstances, trustees must comply with the provisions of their charity’s governing document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"in-more-detail-2\"\u003eIn more detail\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen considering a collaborative working proposal, the trustees should be able to show that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe collaboration furthers their charity’s purposes: as long as the charities can justify the collaboration as furthering their own purposes, there is scope for collaborative working.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit is an appropriate use of charitable funds: resources used for the collaboration must be reasonable in relation to the extent to which the purposes are furthered\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eany private benefit is incidental: private benefits are benefits that people or organisations may receive other than as a beneficiary. Where people or organisations benefit from a charity in this way, then those sorts of ‘private’ benefits must be incidental, which means they are a necessary result, or by-product, of carrying out the charity’s aims. For further information on this subject see \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/charitable-purposes-and-public-benefit\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eCharitable purposes and public benefit\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTrustees must properly exercise their duty of care. This means that they should thoroughly consider the possible risks involved in collaborative working. In particular, when considering using charity property or assets in a collaboration, trustees should properly assess the likely risks as well as the potential benefits. Where there is a question about the proposed use of, and likely risks to, any type of charity property (for example, giving a loan to a joint venture), charities should take their own independent professional advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn all collaborations charities should consider what would happen if one of the parties was suddenly unable to meet its obligations. It is important to consider whether the remaining party or parties would be able to continue in the working arrangement. Should anything go wrong, issues of liability can have wider implications for the charities involved, with repercussions for their assets and reputation. For these reasons it is important to have a clear formal agreement proportionate to the potential risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"when-does-the-commission-need-to-be-involved\"\u003eWhen does the Commission need to be involved?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-answer\"\u003eThe answer\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, there are no legal barriers to charities working collaboratively in furtherance of their purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, charities collaborate with other charities. However, charities will sometimes work with public and private sector partners. In all cases, trustees must be confident that the collaboration furthers their charity’s purposes, is an appropriate use of charitable funds and that any private benefit is incidental to the furtherance of the charity’s purposes.

This could involve, for example, a parent charity setting up other charities and non-charitable subsidiaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGroups can take many forms and a range of terminology is used to describe the parties involved. However, a group structure is likely to have some or all of the following features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe group members act as a collective to deliver a range of services to beneficiaries\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe arrangement is formalised by a contract, service level agreement or memorandum of understanding\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe group will often include a parent organisation with one or more other charities and non-charitable subsidiaries\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe group may consist of organisations which are both charitable and non-charitable\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe group might consist of only incorporated organisations and, as such, be subject to the Companies Act\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eall organisations within the group will have their own name and distinct purposes (although it is likely that these will be similar in some way)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe group will produce consolidated accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome charities will wish to undertake activities that fall outside of their core business. These activities may be specialist or involve some form or risk. Hiving them off to other charities or to non-charitable subsidiaries can enable the parent charity to support and promote those activities while treating them as separate businesses, so not putting the parent charity’s funds and assets at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis situation can also be achieved by a charity becoming the parent body of other already existing charities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere charities are separate entities in the group structure, administrative linking (where this is legally possible) can enable the charities to share a registration number and produce one set of accounts. Linking is not a merger; the charities remain separate entities.

Each local charity will have its own trustees who have responsibility for the general control and management of the local charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"an-example-of-how-an-affiliated-or-federal-structure-works\"\u003eAn example of how an affiliated or federal structure works\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA national charity is set up to support and assist people with disabilities. Its members, who are also independent charities,  also have purposes to support and assist people with disabilities but limited to a local geographical area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe members of this affiliated structure are bound together by a common name, brand and purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a condition of membership the members of the group will usually be asked to use a standard governing document provided by the national body. In addition, the national body may exercise rights to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapprove any member’s change of name\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapprove any member’s change of purposes or area of benefit\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003esuspend membership for a proper reason\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eapprove the disposal of assets upon dissolution\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe national body typically has an advisory and supportive function.  In some cases, it can place conditions on how the member charities operate, in return for using the brand or name. Where the national charity is responsible for the general control and management of the local charities, that may mean the local bodies are not independent charities but merely branches of the main charity. In such a case there is only one charity and it is not an affiliated or federal structure. In this situation, whilst these local branches or committees have no discretion over policies to be adopted (except within limits agreed with the national trustee body) they do have the benefits of working under the umbrella of the national charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"coalition-structures\"\u003eCoalition structures\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the purposes of this guidance only, the Commission is using the term ‘coalition structure’ to describe a structure that exists where a number of separate charities agree to work together for a common purpose, sometimes described as ‘a partnership of equals’. The agreement may be only a temporary collaboration with a certain aim in mind, or it could be established on a more formal basis with a new association being set up.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-types-of-formal-collaborative-arrangements-are-there\"\u003eWhat types of formal collaborative arrangements are there?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"the-short-answer-legal-requirement-2\"\u003eThe short answer (legal requirement)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFormal collaborative arrangements can vary in type.

Agreements should be sufficiently robust to protect each party’s interests and take account of the risks, but not so burdensome as to hold back innovation or incur unreasonable administration costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"in-more-detail-4\"\u003eIn more detail\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInformal collaboration will usually be more appropriate where the collaboration involves low risk activities such as sharing knowledge, experience or best practice information. However, even for such informal collaborations the arrangements and procedures should be clearly set out in writing to avoid any confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFormal arrangements, if they are drawn up carefully, enable charity trustees to better identify and manage risks including risks to the charity’s assets and reputation. Depending upon their trustee and staff skills and experience, charity trustees may need to seek specialist professional advice when entering into a formal collaborative working arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCollaboration may take the form of a joint venture which is operated through the vehicle of a separate company, set up to separate the collaborative working element from the continuing activities of each charity in the arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a formal arrangement is proposed, trustees should ensure that their charity can meet the terms of any contract they enter into throughout the period of its existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA key overall message is that it is important to set the ground rules but not to over-complicate the arrangements. It is also important that an agreement for terminating the arrangements is drawn up from the beginning in case circumstances change and the arrangement is no longer viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

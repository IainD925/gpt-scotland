This will help tenants at an early stage of the possession process, mitigating the risk of tenants becoming homeless and helping to sustain tenancies where possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTogether these measures strike the right balance between prioritising public health and supporting the most vulnerable renters, whilst ensuring landlords can access and exercise their right to justice in the most serious cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-information\"\u003eFurther information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe package of support is reducing the number of evictions as applications to the courts for possession by private and social landlords were down 67% between October and December 2020, compared to the same quarter in 2019. The number of repossessions recorded October to December 2020 was down 93% compared to the same quarter in 2019.  Only 548 repossessions were recorded between April and December 2020 compared to 22,444 in the same period in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe government previously changed the law in England to ensure bailiffs do not enforce evictions for 6 weeks until 22 February. This has now been extended for a further 6 weeks until 31 March. This will be kept under review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe only exceptions to this are for the most egregious cases – anti-social behaviour, illegal occupation, death of a tenant where the property is unoccupied, fraud, perpetrators of domestic abuse in social housing and rent arrears equivalent to at least 6 months’ rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-the-possession-action-process-guidance-for-landlords-and-tenants\"\u003eGuidance\u003c/a\u003e to support landlords and tenants in the social and private rented sectors understand the possession action process and new rules within the court system in England and Wales is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"contact_bfc00333-a9ee-4ca1-9d3c-432dbcdf4640\" class=\"contact postal-address\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"vcard contact-inner\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eOffice address and general enquiries\u003c/p\u003e\n    \n      \u003cp class=\"adr\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"street-address\"\u003e2 Marsham StreetLondon\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"postal-code\"\u003eSW1P 4DF\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \n    \n      \u003cdiv class=\"email-url-number\"\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"contact_form_url\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eContact form\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-the-ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government\"\u003ehttps://www.gov.uk/gui...\u003c/a\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \n        \u003cp class=\"tel\"\u003e\n          \u003cspan class=\"type\"\u003eGeneral enquiries:  please use this number if you are a member of the public\u003c/span\u003e\n          030 3444 0000\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003cp class=\"comments\"\u003eIf your enquiry is related to COVID-19 please check our guidance page first before you contact us - \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government\"\u003ehttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you still need to contact us please use the contact form above to get in touch, because of coronavirus (COVID-19).

For example, an apartment building containing one person studios could deliver significantly more dwellings per hectare, but significantly fewer bedspaces per hectare, than a terrace of family-sized townhouses on a similarly sized site. It is therefore important to consider how housing needs, local character and appropriate building forms relate to the density measures being used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 005 Reference ID: 66-005-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-are-daylight-and-sunlight-regulated\"\u003eHow are daylight and sunlight regulated?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere a planning application is submitted, local planning authorities will need to consider whether the proposed development would have an unreasonable impact on the daylight and sunlight levels enjoyed by neighbouring occupiers, as well as assessing whether daylight and sunlight within the development itself will provide satisfactory living conditions for future occupants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, properties benefit from a legal \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/rights-to-light/#related\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘right to light’\u003c/a\u003e, which is an easement that gives a landowner the right to receive light through specified openings, and can be used to prevent this from being obstructed without the owner’s consent.

What this means in practice, in relation to assessing appropriate levels of sunlight and daylight, will depend to some extent on the context for the development as well as its detailed design. For example in areas of high-density historic buildings, or city centre locations where tall modern buildings predominate, lower daylight and daylight and sunlight levels at some windows may be unavoidable if new developments are to be in keeping with the general form of their surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn such situations good design (such as giving careful consideration to a building’s massing and layout of habitable rooms) will be necessary to help make the best use of the site and maintain acceptable living standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eParagraph: 007 Reference ID: 66-007-20190722\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevision date: 22 07 2019\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

The government is stepping in to safeguard funding and make sure these much-needed homes are not lost altogether, extending the current Affordable Homes Programme until March 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHomes to be built under the government’s £9 billion scheme originally needed shovels to be in the ground by March 2022. However, today’s announcement means that housing associations and councils have a year longer to begin building these homes while still receiving government support, giving them the flexibility and certainty they need to keep building across the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe announcement follows confirmation last week that the new £12 billion Affordable Homes Programme – which will start next year – will support up to 180,000 new affordable homes, including for shared ownership and social rent. The programme will lead to a further £38 billion in public and private investment in affordable housing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"housing-secretary-rt-hon-robert-jenrick-mp-said\"\u003eHousing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eToday I am announcing that we are giving more flexibility to housing associations and councils to help them deliver affordable homes.

This includes making it easier to repurpose more commercial premises without requiring a planning application, builders no longer needing a planning application to demolish and rebuild unused buildings if they are rebuilt as homes, and property owners being able to build additional space above their properties through a fast track approval process.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eA new, ambitious cross-government strategy, to be published ahead of the Spending Review, looking at how public sector land can be managed and released so it can be put to better use.

It sets out the requirements for the administration of the funding and describes how the Education Funding Agency (EFA) will collect monitoring information for the scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are reminded that they must ensure RBF expenditure is appropriate and in line with the scheme rules set out in this guide. RBF may only be used to support accommodation cost for residential students and to support travel between the student’s term time lodgings (if they live off site) and the institution. It must not be used for hardship or to provide help with childcare costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rbf-policy-in-the-2015-to-2016-academic-year\"\u003eRBF policy in the 2015 to 2016 academic year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF provides financial help towards the costs of accommodation for students attending one of the designated institutions delivering specialist provision, where that provision requires the student to be resident in order to participate because it is not available locally and/or because it requires students to be available at unsociable hours on a regular basis. RBF enables young people to achieve a substantial qualification in a specialist subject they would not be able to obtain at a non-specialist institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF provides a contribution towards residential costs for those students the institution identifies face the most significant financial barriers to participation. It is not intended to provide support to all students on residentially delivered provision at an institution; nor is it intended to necessarily cover the full costs for each student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF should be used to help students with the costs of accommodation whilst they are in further education; the accommodation may be owned or managed by the institution or be owned by a private landlord. It is anticipated that the majority of RBF funding will be used to cover accommodation costs, however, RBF may also be used to help with travel costs between the student’s term time lodgings and the institution where appropriate. The use of RBF for travel costs for non-residential students, ie for home to institution travel costs, is not permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions use RBF for travel, the amount spent should not exceed 15% of their total RBF allocation.  In order to ensure RBF maintains its’ primary focus on residential support, travel expenditure is also capped at £25,000. In other words, where 15% of the institution’s allocation is greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum the institution may spend on travel costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf institutions face exceptional circumstances in which they feel that a greater level of travel expenditure is required, they should submit a business case to the EFA \u003ca href=\"mailto:jayne.lievesley@education.gsi.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003ejayne.lievesley@education.gsi.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are permitted to use up to 5% of their allocation for administrative costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF may not be used for any purpose other than the above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"student-eligibility\"\u003eStudent eligibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"age\"\u003eAge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo be eligible for RBF in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, students must be aged at least 16 and under 19 on 31 August 2015. Where a student turns 19 during their programme of study, they can continue to be supported to the end of the academic year in which they turn 19 or to the end of their programme of study, whichever is sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"residency\"\u003eResidency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudents must satisfy the residency criteria set out in the 2015 to 2016 academic year \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEFA Funding Regulations\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"household-income\"\u003eHousehold income\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should manage the number and size of RBF awards they make to keep within their budget, targeting available funds towards those facing the most significant financial barriers to participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should assess the young person’s actual need for help with residential costs before determining whether to award RBF support. RBF should not routinely be awarded simply because a student is enrolled in residentially delivered provision.  Institutions should take account of the young person’s household income as evidenced by receipt of benefits and/or P60, Tax Credit Award Notice or evidence of self-employment income before awarding RBF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"assessment-and-payment-of-rbf\"\u003eAssessment and payment of RBF\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions have the discretion, in line with this guide, to determine which students receive RBF support and how much support they should receive. Institutions should manage the number and size of RBF awards the make to keep within their budget, targeting available funds towards those facing the most significant financial barriers to participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should assess each student’s actual need for help with residential costs, ie by assessing their household income, before determining whether to award RBF support. RBF should not routinely be awarded simply because a student is enrolled in residentially delivered provision.  It is good practice for institutions to publish their RBF policy to help students understand the criteria against which they will be assessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF payments for accommodation must be made directly to the student’s landlord (which may be the institution itself if they provide accommodation directly or to a private landlord) for accommodation costs.  No payments should be made directly to the student (any such payment would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income related Benefits Regulations 2000). Receipt of other benefits and/or financial support does not exclude a student from receiving help with residential support if he/she is experiencing financial difficulties in meeting the costs associated with participating in education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions may wish to consider retaining a contingency fund to respond to needs which emerge later in the academic year in response to changes in a student’s circumstances rather than allocating all funds at the start of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions who use RBF to support students travel costs from their term time lodgings to site (up to the maximum of 15% of their allocation, capped at £25,000; in other words, where 15% of the institution’s allocation is greater than £25,000, £25,000 is the maximum amount that may be spent).  The use of RBF for travel costs does not replace the statutory duty on local authorities to set out (in an annually published transport statement) the arrangements they will make to facilitate the participation in education or training of young people of sixth form age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRBF should not be used by an institution for any purpose designed to give them a competitive advantage over other institutions; nor should RBF be used for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eenrolment or administration fees\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003efees for access to college facilities\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eblock subsidy of transport\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ecosts that are  in the scope of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003echildcare costs that are in the scope of the Care to Learn scheme\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn determining arrangements for payment of RBF, institutions are subject to equalities legislation, which means they must not discriminate against their students on the basis of their protected characteristics. They are also subject to the public sector equality duty in section 149(1) of the Equality Act 2010.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a student is unhappy about the way in which their request for RBF support is handled they should follow the institution’s normal complaints procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"allocations\"\u003eAllocations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"call-to-action\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRBF allocations will be paid to institutions in three instalments: 50% in August, 25% in December and 25% in March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAllocations are made to institutions to manage at their own discretion but in line with this guide. Allocations for the 2015 to 2016 academic year are based on actual expenditure at each institution over a two year period and an assessment of trends over the same period.

The EFA would like to remind institutions that the 5% administrative costs are part of their allocation total; they are not an additional 5% on top of the allocation total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions should use the funding allocated to them for RBF solely to support eligible students with residential costs in line with RBF policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere institutions identify that they will be unable to spend the majority of their RBF allocation, they should notify the EFA as soon as possible to arrange to repay the excess by \u003ca href=\"mailto:Enquiries.EFA@education.gsi.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEnquiries.EFA@education.gsi.gov.uk\u003c/a\u003e .

In line with usual practice, any unspent funds will be recovered. Data supplied in this return will be used to generate future allocations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstitutions are also strongly encouraged to complete the ILR (Learning Funding and Monitoring (FAM); learner support reason) to report students who have been assessed as eligible for RBF and who have taken up the funding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe EFA will also request minimal Management Information (MI) to support its monitoring of RBF and to inform future year’s allocations.

They’re not regarded as ‘sea’ for the purposes of most merchant shipping legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-inland-waters-are-classified\"\u003eHow inland waters are classified\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInland waters are classified as one of four categories:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCategory A:  narrow rivers and canals where the water is generally less than 1.5 metres deep\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCategory B: wider rivers and canals where the water is generally 1.5 metres or more deep, and where the significant wave height couldn’t be expected to be more than 0.6 metres at any time\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCategory C: tidal rivers, estuaries and large, deep lakes and lochs where the significant wave height couldn’t be expected to be more than 1.2 metres at any time\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCategory D: tidal rivers and estuaries where the significant wave height couldn’t be expected to be more than 2 metres at any time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWater categorisation matters are co-ordinated by the Navigation Safety Branch of MCA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese categories are defined and listed in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1837-categorisation-of-waters\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eMSN 1837\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-apply-for-categorisation-or-re-categorisation-of-waters\"\u003eHow to apply for categorisation or re-categorisation of waters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou (as an individual or organisation) can apply for categorisation, or to change an existing categorisation,of a defined area of inland water. You must have an interest in the area requested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMCA will consider any request for the categorisation of new or for changes in the existing categorisation of areas. The NSB co-ordinates the categorisation of a defined area of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eContact your local marine office to get advice about categorisation of a particular stretch of water and making an application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour application to your local Marine Office needs to be fully supported with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eChart or chartlet of location;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRecent baythemetric data with spot soundings and/or depth contours shown on charts;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLevels of vessel movement;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eTypes of vessel using the area;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePhysical description of the area;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDetails of significant wave heights;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ePredominant wind chart for the area;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGeneral rationale to support the application;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSupporting letter from the local Harbour/Navigation Authority, as applicable.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-about-significant-wave-heights\"\u003eMore about significant wave heights\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor your application, you must also give evidence showing how the significant wave height has been established.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn each category, a maximum significant wave height has been given. Your evidence needs to show that the wave height does not go above this limit at a representative point (or points) in the area you wish to have categorised or re-categorised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis evidence could, for example, be based on information taken from a mathematical model of the geographic area. This should be validated by wave height observations from a wave rider buoy, or a seabed pressure sensor. Other evidence may be accepted if considered suitable by the MCA expert group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaximum significant wave height limits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCategory B: up to 0.6 metres\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCategory C: up to 1.2 metres\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCategory D: up to 2.0 metres\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe time of year your application covers will also be a factor. For an application for a winter or summer seasonal area, measurements should represent the period of worst weather. For all-year-round applications, measurements should represent the worst winter conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to wave heights, other factors may have to be taken into consideration when determining categories of water.  For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe strength of tidal stream;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eRelevant local phenomena (for example, a bore).\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe effect of underwater banks on the tidal streams;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe fetch of the wind, especially in long, straight estuaries with a low-lying hinterland;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe effect of shifting underwater sand banks which result in changing navigational channels;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHeight of banks at the water’s edge and the degree of shelter that may be found in bad weather;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe effect of any surrounding high land which may give rise to sudden and unpredictable wind shifts and strengths;\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe effect of the prevailing wind against the tidal stream which can shorten the sea, giving rise to steeper waves which are more liable to break; \nand\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAny available data that can prove wave heights will be affected by climate change.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-your-application-is-processed\"\u003eHow your application is processed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eSend your application and supporting documents to the local Marine Office for the attention of the Surveyor-in-Charge (SIC) or Area Operations Manager (AOM).\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe SIC or AOM will consult the District Safety Committee or Small Passenger Ship Steering Group as appropriate.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf they’re content with the application they’ll send their comments or recommendations to the NSB.

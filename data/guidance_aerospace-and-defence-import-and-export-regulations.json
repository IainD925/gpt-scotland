The F680 process gives an indication but not a guarantee that an export licence will subsequently be issued. You must obtain F680 clearance in order to use certain licences.

They permit the export of specified controlled goods that have been assessed as lower strategic risk and to lower risk destinations. There are currently over 40 different types of \u003cabbr title=\"Open General Export Licences\"\u003eOGELs\u003c/abbr\u003e available which licence exports of either military or dual-use goods. There are also \u003cabbr title=\"European Union\"\u003eEU\u003c/abbr\u003e equivalents of \u003cabbr title=\"Open General Export Licences\"\u003eOGELs\u003c/abbr\u003e called \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/european-union-general-export-authorisations\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eEuropean Union General Export Authorisations (\u003cabbr title=\"European Union General Export Authorisation\"\u003eEU GEA\u003c/abbr\u003es)\u003c/a\u003e  which licenses certain dual-use goods.

If you are not permitted to use an \u003cabbr title=\"Open General Export Licence\"\u003eOGEL\u003c/abbr\u003e due to the nature of the goods or export destination (for instance, because you intend to export a controlled item to a sanctioned country), then you need to apply for an \u003cabbr title=\"Standard Individual Export Licence\"\u003eSIEL\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eOpen Individual Export Licence (\u003cabbr title=\"Open Individual Export Licence\"\u003eOIEL\u003c/abbr\u003e) - issued for a specific exporter and allows different goods to be sent to various destinations.
